<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>AT NEW CONSTANTINOPLE</h3>
</div>
<p>IT had been snowing hard for twenty-four hours at
Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch. Beginning with a few feathery
particles, they had steadily increased in number until
the biting air was filled with billions of snowflakes,
which whirled and eddied in the gale that howled
through the gorges and ca&ntilde;ons of the Sierras. It was
still snowing with no sign of cessation, and the blizzard
blanketed the earth to the depth of several feet, filling
up the treacherous hollows, caverns and abysses and
making travel almost impossible for man or animal.</p>
<p>The shanties of the miners in Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch
were just eleven in number. They were strung along
the eastern side of the gorge and at an altitude of two
or three hundred feet from the bed of the pass or ca&ntilde;on.
The site protruded in the form of a table-land, offering
a secure foundation for the structures, which were thus
elevated sufficiently to be beyond reach of the terrific
torrents that sometimes rushed through the ravine during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
the melting of the snow in the spring, or after one
of those fierce cloud-bursts that give scarcely a minute&rsquo;s
warning of their coming.</p>
<p>The diggings were in the mountain side at varying
distances. The success in mining had been only moderate,
although several promising finds raised hopes.
The population numbered precisely thirty men, representing
all quarters of the Union, while five came from
Europe. The majority were shaggy, bronzed adventurers,
the variety being almost as great as the numbers.
Some had been clerks, several were college graduates,
a number were the sons of wealthy parents, and
one was a full-fledged parson, while there was a certain
percentage who had left their homes to escape the grip
of the offended law.</p>
<p>With that yearning for picturesqueness which is a
peculiar trait of Americans, the miners felt that when
their settlement had attained the dignity of nearly a
dozen dwellings, it was entitled to an appropriate name.
The gorge, which seemed to have been gouged out of
the solid mass of boulders and rocks, when the mountains
were split apart in the remote past, was known
from the first by the title already given, which also
clung to the diggings themselves.</p>
<p>The single saloon presided over by Max Ortigies,
was the Heavenly Bower,&ndash;&ndash;so <i>that</i> point was settled,
but when it came to naming the settlement itself, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
difficulties were so numerous that days and weeks
passed without an agreement being reached. No matter
how striking and expressive the title offered by one
man, the majority promptly protested. It was too sulphurous,
or too insipid or it lacked in that nebulous
characteristic which may be defined as true Americanism.
It looked as if the problem would never be solved,
when Landlord Ortigies, taking the bull by the horns,
appointed a committee of three to select a name, the
others pledging themselves to accept whatever the committee
submitted.</p>
<p>But the mischief was to pay when on the night of the
blizzard the committee met at the Heavenly Bower to
make their report. The chairman insisted upon &ldquo;E
Pluribus Unum,&rdquo; the second member&rsquo;s favorite was
&ldquo;Murderer&rsquo;s Holler,&rdquo; while the third would not listen
to anything except &ldquo;Wolf Eye,&rdquo; and each was immovably
set in his convictions.</p>
<p>Budge Isham was not a member of the committee,
but he was known as a college graduate. From his seat
on an overturned box at the rear of the room, where he
was smoking a pipe, he asked troublesome questions
and succeeded in arraying the committeemen so fiercely
against one another that each was eager to vote, in the
event of failing to carry his own point, in favor of any
name objectionable to the rest.</p>
<p>The chairman as stated favored the patriotic name
&ldquo;E Pluribus Unum,&rdquo; and boldly announced the fact.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It has a lofty sound,&rdquo; blandly remarked Isham;
&ldquo;will the chairman be good enough to translate it for
us? In other words, what does &lsquo;E Pluribus Unum&rsquo;
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied the chairman with scorn in his manner;
&ldquo;everybody oughter know it means, &lsquo;Hurrah
for the red, white and blue.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; returned Isham, puffing at his pipe.</p>
<p>Vose Adams, the second committeeman, felt it his
duty to explain his position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with that outlandish name is in the fust
place that it has three words and consequently it&rsquo;s too
much to manage. Whoever heard of a town with three
handles to its name? Then it&rsquo;s foreign. When I was in
college (several disrespectful sniffs which caused the
speaker to stop and glare around in quest of the offenders);
I say when I was in college and studying
Greek and Chinese and Russian, I larned that that
name was made up of all three of them languages. I
b&rsquo;leve in America for the Americans, and if we can&rsquo;t
find a name that&rsquo;s in the American language, why let&rsquo;s
wait till we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sentiment was delivered with such dramatic
force that several of the miners nodded their heads in
approval. It was an appeal to the patriotic side of their
nature&ndash;&ndash;which was quick to respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Budge Isham, addressing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
landlord, who, by general consent, was the presiding
officer at these disputations, and who like the others
failed to see the quiet amusement the educated man was
extracting, &ldquo;if it is agreeable to Mr. Adams, to whose
eloquent speech we have listened with much edification,
I would like him to give us his reasons for calling our
handsome town &lsquo;Murderers&rsquo; Hollow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman appealed to rose to his feet. Turning
toward the man who had called upon him, he gave him
a look which ought to have made him sink to the floor
with mortification, preliminary to saying with polished
irony:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the gentleman had paid attention as he oughter,
he would have obsarved that I said &lsquo;Murderer&rsquo;s Holler,&rsquo;
not &lsquo;Murderers&rsquo; <i>Hollow</i>.&rsquo; I would advise him not
to forget that he ain&rsquo;t the only man in this place that
has received a college eddycation. Now as to the name:
it proclaims our stern virtue and love for law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orator paused, but the wondering expression of
the bronzed faces turned toward him showed that he
would have to descend to particulars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When violators of the law hear that name, what
does it say to them? It says that if any murderer shows
his face in this place, he will receive such rough handling
that he will have to holler &lsquo;enough,&rsquo; and will be
glad to get out&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t see what there is to laugh at!&rdquo;
exclaimed Vose angrily, looking threateningly around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
again with his fists clenched and his gaze fixed specially
upon the grinning Budge Isham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some sense in what Vose says, which ain&rsquo;t
often the case,&rdquo; remarked Ike Hoe, the other member
of the committee, &ldquo;but the trouble will be that when
folks hear of the name, they won&rsquo;t think to give it the
meanin&rsquo; that he gives it. They&rsquo;ll conclude that this
place is the home of murderers, and, if it keeps on,
bime by of hoss thieves. If it warn&rsquo;t for that danger, I
might go in for backing up Vose with his name, but as
it stands it won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The argument of Ike had produced its effect. There
was little sympathy in the first place for the title, and
that little was destroyed by the words of Ike, who proceeded
to plead for his own choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now as to &lsquo;Wolf Eye.&rsquo; In the first place, it is short
and easy to say. There ain&rsquo;t any slur in the name, that
might offend a new comer, who would think the &lsquo;Murderer&rsquo;s
Holler&rsquo; contained ungentlemanly allusions to
his past. It is warning, too, that the place has got an
eye on everybody and has teeth as sharp as a wolf.
Then there is poetry in the name. Gentlemen,&rdquo; added
Ike in a burst of enthusiasm, &ldquo;we oughter go in for
poetry. How can any one live in such a glorious country
as this with the towering kenyons around him, with
the mountains thousands of feet deep, with the grand
sun kissin&rsquo; the western tips in the morning and sinking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
to rest at night in the east,&ndash;&ndash;with the snow storms in
summer and the blazing heat in winter&ndash;&ndash;with the
glo&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on! hold on!&rdquo; called Budge Isham, rising
solemnly to his feet, with hands uplifted in protest; &ldquo;if
Ike doesn&rsquo;t stop, he&rsquo;ll have us all standing on our heads.
There&rsquo;s a brand of liquor down in Sacramento called
&lsquo;Wolf Eye;&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t make any charges, gentlemen,
against my friend Ike, but you can draw your inferences.
Wolf Eye won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general laugh greeted this sally, seeing which the
indignant Ike turned the tables upon Budge with an
admirable piece of sarcasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing as how all of us together don&rsquo;t know &rsquo;nough
to git up a name that will suit, I move that the college
eddycated gentleman supplies the brains and does it
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crushing irony of this remark was spoiled by
Budge accepting it in all seriousness. He bowed his
head and gracefully thanked the satirical Vose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very glad to do so. The committee meant
well enough, but the trouble was that there were too
many fools on it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Wade Ruggles sprang to his feet, with
the fierce question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the gentleman refer to <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hand was at his hip on the butt of his revolver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
and matters looked squally, but the tactful Budge
quelled the rising storm with Chesterfieldian grace.
Waving his hand and bowing, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not intend the remotest reference to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vose Adams came up promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s <i>me</i> and I&rsquo;m ready to make any man eat
his words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good friend is mistaken; nothing could induce
me to apply such a term to him; I hold him in too high
esteem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since this left Ike Hoe as the only remaining member,
he began to show signs of explosion, perceiving
which the incomprehensible Budge proceeded to mollify
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ike knows that I would be the last person in
the world to slur a gentleman from whom I as well as
the others have received so much instruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ike was mystified. He looked at the other members
of the committee and then into the faces of the group.
He couldn&rsquo;t make it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all the same, Mr. Chairman, since the gentleman
has said there was too many fools on the committee,
and has just explained that he didn&rsquo;t mean any one
of us three, I&rsquo;ll be obliged if he&rsquo;ll explain who in thunder
he did mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sounded unanswerable, but the cunning Budge
was equal to the occasion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It gives me pleasure to answer the question of the
gentleman: my remark was made in a Pickwickian
sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward with a beaming smile, as if his explanation
left nothing to be added. No one understood
to what he referred, but all were too proud to admit
the fact. There was a general nodding of heads, and
Ike, with the manner of a man who magnanimously accepts
the humble apology of him whom he has worsted,
leaned back on his stool and audibly remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Budge Isham resumed his seat, when he was reminded
that he was expected to submit a name for the
new settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; he said, rising again, &ldquo;it is a fact
known to this highly intelligent assemblage, that every
city of prominence in Europe has from one to forty
namesakes in this country. There is one exception, however;
doubtless all know to what city I refer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to his inquiring looks, the group tried to
appear as if the name was familiar to them, but no one
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hardly necessary for me to mention the city,
but I may say it is Constantinople.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A contemptuous sniff greeted this proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst yet,&rdquo; said Wade Ruggles, drawing
a match along the thigh of his trousers to relight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
his pipe, which had gone out during the excitement;
&ldquo;the man that insults this party with such a proposition,
ought to be run out of the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo; demanded Budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too long in the fust place,&rdquo; commented Ike
Hoe; &ldquo;it bothers a man to git his mouth around it and
it hain&rsquo;t any music, like the other names such as Starvation
Kenyon, Hangman&rsquo;s Noose, Blizzard Gorge and
the rest. I stick to mine as the purtiest of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blazes,&rsquo; short and sweet and innercent like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Landlord Ortigies was leaning with both elbows on
the bar. The new name struck him favorably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with Budge,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;cause
there hain&rsquo;t any other place that&rsquo;s hit onto it. All of
them names that you chaps have tried to spring onto us,
have been used in other places, or at least some part of
the names, but, as Budge has observed, no galoot has
scooped &lsquo;Constantinople.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause no one ain&rsquo;t fool enough,&rdquo; observed Ike
Hoe, who noted the drift of the sentiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll pounce onto it powerful quick if we
don&rsquo;t grab it while it&rsquo;s passin&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s a good long name,
and what if it does make a chap sling the muscles of his
jaw to warble it? All the better; it&rsquo;ll make him think
well of his town, which I prophesy is going to be the
emporium of the West.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; growled Wade Ruggles, &ldquo;Constantinople
is in Ireland isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your eddycation?&rdquo; sneered Ike Vose;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the oldest town in Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Landlord Ortigies raised his head and filled the room
with his genial laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there was anything I was strong on when I led
my class at the Squankum High School it was astronermy;
I was never catched in locating places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know so much,&rdquo; remarked Ruggles, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
let us know something &rsquo;bout that town which I scorn
to name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m allers ready to enlighten ign&rsquo;rance, though I&rsquo;ve
never visited Constantinople, which stands on the top
of the Himalaya Mountains, in the southern part of
Iceland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good,&rdquo; said Budge Isham, who with
his usual tact maneuvered to keep the ally he had
gained, &ldquo;but the Constantinople I have in mind is in
Turkey, which is such a goodly sized country that it
straddles from Europe to Asia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which the same I suppose means to imply that this
ere Constantinople will do likewise similar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;ll do in time,&rdquo; assented the
landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg to offer an amendment to my own motion,&rdquo;
continued the oily Budge; &ldquo;when the boom strikes this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
town, as it is bound soon to do, and it rivals in size the
famous city on the other side of the Atlantic, there
should be something to distinguish the two. We have
no wish to rob any other place of the honors it has
taken centuries to gain; so, while we reserve the principal
name, I propose that we distinguish it from the old
city by prefixing the word &lsquo;New.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that this town shall be &lsquo;New Constantinople?&rsquo;&rdquo;
was the inquiring remark of the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely; and I now make the motion that that be
our name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were seventeen persons present and it looked
as if a decision was inevitable. The landlord was
shrewd. His first act was to invite all to drink at his
expense, after which he made each pledge himself to
abide by the decision, whatever it might be. These preliminaries
being arranged, a show of hands was called
for. The vote was eight for and eight against the new
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tie,&rdquo; commented the landlord from behind
his immense beard; &ldquo;and therefore the question ain&rsquo;t
settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy &rsquo;nough to settle it,&rdquo; said Ike Hoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take another vote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how that&rsquo;ll do it, onless some one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
changes his mind; but again, gentlemen: all who favor
the new name, raise their right hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight horny palms were elevated in air, while the
same number were displayed in the negative. The landlord
looked troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must keep it up till some one weakens,&rdquo; observed
Wade Ruggles.</p>
<p>The host scanned the earnest faces in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of you gentlemen will promise to weaken
if we keep this thing up for half the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here a week,&rdquo; was the reply of Vose
Adams, while the general nodding of heads showed
that he echoed the sentiments of the others. The landlord
met the crisis with becoming dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, when I was a member of Congress, all
questions that was tied was settled by the presiding officer
casting the deciding vote, and which as aforesaid
we don&rsquo;t lay any claim to being higher than Congress,
I therefore, by virtue of the aforesaid right vested in
me, cast my vote in favor of this city being called New
Constantinople, which the same is on me again; gentlemen,
what will you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a coup d&rsquo;etat, the victory being clinched before
the opposition realized it. Ere the company had
fairly recovered from their bewilderment, Budge Isham
declared that the victory was really his, due to the good
sense and high toned chivalry of his friends, and he insisted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
upon doing the honors. He would accept no denial
and the engaging style in which he acquitted himself
of this duty restored good humor. Thus it was that
the little mining town of the Sierras in the days that are
gone received its title.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Bower consisted of two large apartments,
both on the ground floor. The one at the rear
was used by Landlord Ortigies for sleeping, eating and
partial storage purposes. When Vose Adams made his
quarterly visits to Sacramento, he was accompanied by
two mules. They were not necessary to take and bring
the mail, since the pocket of Adams&rsquo; great coat was
sufficient for that, but they carried down to Sacramento
several empty casks which came back filled, or
rather they were thus when the return journey was begun,
but to the dismay of the proprietor of the Heavenly
Bower, he found that they were barely two-thirds
full, when unloaded at his place. Vose explained that
the leakage was due to the roughness of the trail. Since
there seemed no other way of overcoming this, the
landlord sent an extra cask with the request to Vose
that he would confine his leakage to that and Vose
kindly obliged him.</p>
<p>The stuff thus provided for the Heavenly Bower was
generally in concentrated form, thereby permitting a
dilution which insured a full supply for the customers
who were afflicted with an eternal thirst.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>The bar room was of extensive proportions. Nearly
all of one side was occupied by the bar. Opposite was
the huge fireplace, and scattered around were a number
of stools, rickety chairs and strong boxes which served
equally well for seats.</p>
<p>The crackling fire, the genial warmth and good cheer
within the room were the more striking because of their
contrast with the howling storm without. The gale
roared around the corners of the rude but strong
structure, rattling against the massive door and the log
walls, spitting vicious gusts down the chimney and
flinging great drifts hither and yon with a fury that
threatened to send the building skurrying through the
snowy space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst blizzard we ever had,&rdquo; remarked
Wade Ruggles, after one of these violent outbursts;
&ldquo;God pity any one that&rsquo;s abroad to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It reminds me of that zephyr last winter,&rdquo; observed
Vose Adams, &ldquo;when I was bringing your freight,
Max, from Sacramento.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; nodded the landlord; &ldquo;you started
with two kegs and got here with about half a one; the
leakage was tremenjus on that trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; the blizzards is always rough on Mountain
Dew, and sorter makes it shrink,&rdquo; replied the unblushing
Vose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you stop the casks leaking so much,&rdquo; inquired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
Felix Brush, who had been a parson in Missouri,
and claimed that he had never been &ldquo;unfrocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord solemnly swayed his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as long as Vose has charge of the freight&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant a dull but resounding thump was
heard on the roof overhead. It shook every log in the
structure, checked speech and caused each man to look
wonderingly at his neighbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mountain has fell on us!&rdquo; exclaimed Ike Hoe
in a husky whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was the mountain,&rdquo; said Budge Isham, slightly
raising his voice, as the courage of the party came
back; &ldquo;none of us would be able to tell of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a rock&ndash;&ndash;well, I&rsquo;m blessed! the thing is
moving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something was certainly astir in the mass of snow
overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s a angel that has lost its way,&rdquo; submitted
Hoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely it&rsquo;s a grizzly b&rsquo;ar that&rsquo;s stumbled off
the rocks&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all these speculations were scattered to the winds
by the sound of a voice muffled and seemingly far away,
which came to them through the storm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Helloa, the house</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>WHAT THE BLIZZARD BROUGHT TO NEW CONSTANTINOPLE</h3>
</div>
<p>A moment after the hail was heard from the roof,
the muffled noise which accompanied it ceased. The
stranger groping about in the snowy gloom had stepped
off the roof into the huge drift outside the Heavenly
Bower, and a minute later, lifted the latch of the door
and pushed in among the astonished miners. They saw
the figure of a sturdy man holding something in his
arms, so wrapped round with blankets and coverings
that no one could tell its nature. He stamped the snow
from his boots, shook himself like a shaggy dog, then
walked heavily to the chair which Budge Isham placed
near the fire for him, and almost fell into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, friends,&rdquo; he said in a grave voice;
&ldquo;It was no fault of mine that I tried at first to enter
by the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I built the Heavenly Bower,&rdquo; replied Landlord
Ortigies; &ldquo;I meant to place a door up there, but
there wasn&rsquo;t anybody in New Constantinople with
enough sense to know how to do it. I &rsquo;spose you was
looking fur it, stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t looking for anything;
I was just walking, walking through the storm,
not knowing or caring where I went. I can&rsquo;t say how
far I came, but it must have been a number of miles. I
was still plodding on, when I set my foot on vacancy
and down I went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! you fell nearly a hundred feet,&rdquo; said
Parson Brush; &ldquo;it was a wonderful providence that
saved you from being dashed to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow on the roof must be five or six feet deep,&rdquo;
replied the stranger; &ldquo;for it received me as if it were a
feather bed. I saw a glow from the top of your chimney
against the rocks and knew I was on the roof of a
house. I hardly felt jarred and groped my way off into
a lot more snow and here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astonishment of the listeners did not make them
forget the laws of hospitality. Budge Isham looked significantly
at the landlord, but he had already drawn a
glass of spirits and was coming from behind the bar
with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger, swallow this; you look cold; you&rsquo;re welcome
to the Heavenly Bower, whether you come
through the roof or down the chimbley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; I&rsquo;ll take the whiskey in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then feeling that he owed those who made him
so welcome some explanation of his coming among
them, the stranger said:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, my name is Maurice Dawson. About
two months ago, I left Independence, Missouri, with an
emigrant train for the Pacific coast. The elements, disease
and the Indians made such inroads upon us that
after a time only half a dozen families remained. As if
that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the few survivors quarreled over
the course to follow, most of them aiming for a pass
through the mountains into Southern California, while
I, the greatest fool of them all, set out to find Dead
Man&rsquo;s Gulch, of which I had heard from a party of
trappers. My canvas covered wagon, with a single
span of horses, contained all my worldly goods, and
my companions were my wife and little girl Nellie, only
three years old. Everything might have gone well but
for this blizzard, which jumbled up the points of the
compass and made traveling so difficult that after a
time it became impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All were listening with the closest interest, and every
heart was touched by the emotion of the man, which he
could not control for several minutes. No one interrupted,
and, feeling that his story was not quite completed,
he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fired my gun in the hope of attracting attention,
but fortunately for others I was the only one abroad.
By and by the horses stopped. They could draw the
wagon no further. They stood panting and exhausted
and soon lay down in the snow. I turned to speak to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
my wife, when I found she had been dead for some
minutes, the cold carrying her off as quietly as if she
were dropping asleep. Before she passed away, she
wrapped nearly all her clothing about Nellie, who was
cuddling beside her, so that really the mother, like the
noble woman she was, gave her life for the little one.
It was because Nellie was alive, that I jumped out of the
wagon and began floundering through the snow. I
ploughed blindly forward until providence guided me
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While uttering the last words, Maurice Dawson was
tenderly unwrapping the bundle in his arms. There
were many folds to draw away, but at last he reached
the treasure within, which was his Nellie, still sound
asleep.</p>
<p>If the miners were startled by the resounding thump
on the roof, they were now almost struck dumb with
amazement. They sat with open mouths, staring eyes
and for a minute no one spoke or stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, my Nellie,&rdquo; murmured the father,
bending his head and touching his lips to the cool forehead;
&ldquo;I had no hope of this when I left your dead
mother and started on my tramp through the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A general sigh went up from the group of awed
miners. Wade Ruggles, who had been leaning on the
bar, with his gaze fixed on that of the handsome
stranger, was the first to recover from the spell which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
held them all. Tiptoeing across the room, he paused in
front of the father and his child and stared, wondering
and speechless. Then one by one the others did the
same, until the whole company were grouped around
the man and child, each afraid to whisper, as if doing so
would dissolve the heavenly vision.</p>
<p>When the wrappings had been laid aside, and the little
one was placed upright, she stared bewildered into
the shaggy faces around her. Her big blue eyes were
open to their widest extent, the mass of golden curls
rippled about her shoulders and the fairy-like feet were
inclosed in thick, warm shoes and stockings. The dress
of a dull brown color and thick texture, fitted her tiny
frame perfectly and she formed a most winsome picture
of infantile beauty.</p>
<p>For fully five minutes all stared in silence at the marvelous
picture. As before, Wade Ruggles was the first
to come to himself, but when he spoke, it was in an
awed, hesitating whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she really alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sorrowful face of the father lit up with a faint
smile as he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; thank heaven; alive and well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I touch her?&rdquo; timidly asked Ike Hoe, extending
his finger which faintly brushed the rosy cheek, and
was instantly snatched away as if he felt he had done
a sacrilegious thing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; ventured Ruggles gathering courage, &ldquo;I
wonder now if she would let me take her in my arms
for a minute or so; I won&rsquo;t drop her; but that&rsquo;s too
much to ask, howsumever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he stood hopeful, hesitating and doubtful,
Nellie with a half frightened smile, dived her head under
the arm of her father, as if to get away from the
embarrassing situation. He gently fondled the golden
hair and drew her face into view again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, little one, there&rsquo;s nothing to be frightened
at; these people are all your friends and will do anything
they can to please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; exclaimed Landlord Ortigies, with
a shake of his head; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll do anything in the world
for you; if you say the word, I&rsquo;ll stand on my head or
stand any one else here the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he showed an alarming inclination to invert
himself for the amusement of the child, but she did not
seem to grasp the meaning of the offer. She fixed her
eyes upon Ruggles, who made bold by what seemed a
favorable sign, took a step forward and invitingly extended
his hands. She debated for a moment, whether
to meet the proffer and then with the impulsiveness of
infancy leaned toward him. With a thrill of pleasure
the grizzled miner carefully placed his huge arms underneath
hers, and lifted her as if she were a doll from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
her father&rsquo;s knee. As he did so, every one saw the big
tears trickling down his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, boys,&rdquo; he said apologetically; &ldquo;the
last child I held in these arms was my own Jennie, and
she was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With infinite affection, he pressed his bearded lips
against the chubby cheek, while she, relieved of all fear,
flung her dimpled arms about his neck and kissed him
in return. With one hand, she lifted the flapping hat
from his head and with the other smoothed away the
luxuriant hair from his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you ever so much, but you are crying,&rdquo; she
said sympathetically; &ldquo;what makes you do that?
Haven&rsquo;t you got a little girl like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my precious child; I once had just such a sweet
tot as you, but the good Lord took her from me, and I
love you just as I loved her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what we all are going to do,&rdquo; remarked
Ike Hoe, with a sniff as he drew his sleeve across his
eyes; &ldquo;this beats anything in the history of New Constantinople,
by seven hundred and eighty-four thousand
majority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Wade, you must be fair with us,&rdquo; said the
landlord, reaching out his arms; &ldquo;we all claim an equal
share in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miner felt the truth of this, and without a word
relinquished the treasure. Drawing his handkerchief, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
wiped his eyes clear of their mist and jealously followed
the surrendered one as she was fondled in turn by the
others. First one and then another, until she had completed
the round. All had something pleasant to say to
her and she replied in her sweet innocent way, causing
laughter and winning her path straight to the hearts of
the hardy fellows, to whom such endearments had been
unknown for years, but whose better natures were
stirred by the presence of the child, as if she were in
reality an angel sent from heaven.</p>
<p>Felix Brush had purposely left his turn for the last,
hoping thereby to retain her longer than his friends.
After chatting with her for a moment and repeating
some rigmarole that set her laughing, followed by the
request for him to say it again, he stood her on the bar.
Then he danced in front of her, swung his arms like a
jumping-jack, and told some outlandish fairy story
from the stock that no one had ever suspected he possessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you stand on your head?&rdquo; asked Nellie, rippling
over with fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied, as without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
he inverted himself and cracked his heels together,
though the attitude was such an unfamiliar one
that he careened and went over on his back with a
thump that made the room tremble. Nellie clapped her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
chubby hands with delight and before Brush could repeat
the performance, she called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch me; I&rsquo;m going to jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;m ready for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She recoiled a step to gather momentum and Landlord
Ortigies, terrified at the fear that she might step
off backward, made a dive round the end of the bar,
catching his foot in an obstruction and falling with a
crash that drew all attention to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry; be you hurt?&rdquo; asked Nellie, turning
her head and surveying him, as his face came up to
view like the full moon rising above the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit; I done that on purpose to make you
laugh; I always do that to please good little girls like
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bime by I&rsquo;ll let you fall all the time, but just see me
jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Felix Brush was still standing, with arms outstretched,
and, without a second&rsquo;s hesitation the child
leaped off into space. She showed no fright, for there
was no cause for it, since she was caught fairly and securely.
Inasmuch as she had been fondled by every one,
and the parson had had her longer than anyone else, he
set her down on the floor and she began running here
and there, displaying a childish curiosity to understand
everything in sight. Going to the half-opened door,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
communicating with the darkened apartment at the
rear, she peeped timidly in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who lives in dere?&rdquo; she asked, turning around and
addressing the whole group who were laughingly
watching her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I live,&rdquo; replied Ortigies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live all alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got any little girl like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d give all I have in the world if I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to have me for your little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I would; will you be my little girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baby face became thoughtful. She thrust one
finger in the corner of her mouth and looked down at
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would papa do and those other folks? I will
be the little girl for all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This struck the party as the brightest and wittiest
expression ever made by a mortal. They laughed,
clapped their hands and striking each other on the
shoulder wanted to know whether anything of the like
had ever before been heard. Certainly not. Without
paying any heed to them, Nellie was peering into the
room again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dark and cold,&rdquo; she said in an awed voice, turning
her face around, the better to communicate the information;
&ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>Before she could fairly enter the place, her father,
who was affectionately watching her, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you would better not go in there, Nellie;
it&rsquo;s growing late and is time you prepared for bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix a place for her,&rdquo; said Ortigies; &ldquo;we ain&rsquo;t
much on style here, but I can manage to make her comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will it not discommode you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That little gal can&rsquo;t discommode any one in New
Constantinople; if she would prefer to have me go out
and sleep in the snow, I&rsquo;ll be glad to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just the place for her,&rdquo; interposed Wade Ruggles;
&ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t be better if I had taken a week to get it
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t begin with my quarters,&rdquo; Felix Brush
hastened to say, and there would have been a general
wrangle for the privilege of accommodating the little
one, had not her father, seeing how matters were going,
smilingly raised his hand in protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you, my friends, how much I thank
you all for your kindness. Ah, if my poor wife could
have held out until she reached here, but that was not
to be. I shall be glad to stay with Mr. Ortigies to-night,
and with your permission shall remain for a few days in
your settlement. I have lost everything I owned in the
world, and will need some time to decide what is best
to do. Our stay in New Constantinople will give all a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
better chance to get acquainted with Nellie. I&rsquo;ll surrender
her to you until you get tired of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get tired of her!&rdquo; repeated Vose Adams, voicing
the sentiments of all; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not the kind of galoots to
git tired of an angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father expressed his thanks with such winsome
grace, that every man instinctively felt that he was a
born gentleman. There was not a miner in the room
who did not sympathize with him in his affliction, and
yet they envied him the possession of the child, whose
innocence and beauty impressed them as more wonderful
than they had ever looked upon before. When Felix
Brush whispered to Budge Isham that arrangements
must be made in some way to keep the father with
them, for the sake of having the child, his friend
nodded his head, and said he had made up his mind to
the same effect from the moment the parent referred
to the matter. And the sentiments of these two were
those of the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Nellie, let me prepare you for bed; it&rsquo;s a
long time since you have had that privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little one obediently walked to her father and
turned her back to him that he might better remove her
clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have plenty of covering for her?&rdquo;
remarked the parent inquiringly to the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s all she can need.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>Lifting her on his knee, the father began removing
the shoes and stockings, the little one giving what aid
she could, when it came to the garments. One of the
last acts of the affectionate mother had been to place
upon her child the gown she was accustomed to wear
while asleep. When at last she was ready, she looked
up to her father and asked in a half whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will not be with us to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she will come in the morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until then, my child; don&rsquo;t say anything more
about mamma now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was satisfied, and signified that she was ready to
have her father carry her to her bed. Then she exclaimed
with a laugh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that funny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to fordot to say my prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And slipping from her father&rsquo;s knee, she knelt on the
floor, with her hands covering her face which, as it
pressed his knee, was hidden by the mass of golden
ringlets clustering and falling about it. Not a man
stirred or spoke. All were so silent that the sifting of
the snow against the logs, the moaning of the gale and
the soft rustle of the embers that broke apart on the
hearth were audible. But all these were as the &ldquo;voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
of silence&rdquo; itself, so that when the child began her
prayer in a low voice, every syllable was heard.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Now I lay me down to sleep.<br />
I pray the Lord my soul to keep;<br />
If I should die before I wake,<br />
I pray the Lord my soul to take.<br />
God bless papa, mamma and make Nellie a good girl; bless&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Wheeling short round at the silent, awed group, she
looked at the landlord and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or-ti-gies,&rdquo; he replied, pronouncing it carefully.</p>
<p>She made rather sorry work at first, but there could
be no doubt that the One to whom she was addressing
the petition understood her wishes. When she had satisfied
herself and included the landlord in her prayer,
she ceased again, and this time looked up at her father
whose hand was resting on her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must pray for <i>all</i> of them, musn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know dere names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will all tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No act of worship in church or grand cathedral was
more solemn and reverential than that of the men, as
each in turn stepped softly forward with bowed head,
and repeated his name to the tiny petitioner, who immediately
included it with those for whom she had already
prayed and it was wafted upward through space to
Him who delights to hear and answer such petitions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>She did not forget one. To make sure, she looked up
while still on her knees and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I fordot any of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the parent; &ldquo;you have not missed any.
That&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know they will all be good, for I asked God
to make &rsquo;em so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father now rose to his feet with her in his arms,
and she called a general good night, flinging a kiss to
all. Landlord Ortigies had lit an extra lamp and with
it in hand, he led the way to the rear room, where as he
stated, comfortable quarters were provided for the little
one. Since the Heavenly Bower was the only place in
the mining settlement where the wanderer, who occasionally
made his way into that remote part of the
world, could expect to find sleeping accommodations,
Ortigies was always prepared for visitors. Thus he
was able to furnish the father with a couch so placed
that he virtually shared the bed with his child.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, when he stole back into the room
with the landlord to see whether everything was right
with his child, she was found sunk in the sweet, dreamless
slumber of infancy. The picture was so winsome
as she lay with her cheek resting upon the rough pillow,
that Ortigies stepped softly to the door and beckoned to
his friends. Everyone stole forward, and stood looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
down for several minutes upon the sleeper, and, as he
did so, new resolves sprang into his heart. Already it
may be said they were better men because of the blessed
messenger that had come among them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A SLIP OR TWO</h3>
</div>
<p>The blizzard gradually subsided toward morning,
but when the fall of snow ceased, it lay to the depth of
several feet on the level, while the gorges were choked
with vast drifts. The cold was below zero and no work
could be done in the diggings until a rise in temperature
came.</p>
<p>It was hardly light, however, on the succeeding
morning, when three of the miners accompanied Maurice
Dawson in his search for the abandoned wagon and
team. There was not a trace of anything resembling a
trail, the footprints of the man having been obliterated
by the wind-driven snow, and the skill of the party was
taxed to the utmost. Several times they were compelled
to rest, and Dawson himself suggested that the
search be given up until a change in the weather; but
the kind hearted men saw how deeply he grieved, and
their sympathy kept them toiling until about noon when
success came.</p>
<p>The wagon was so covered with snow that it resembled
a hummock, which ordinarily would have been
passed without notice. The horses and the inanimate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
form within were like blocks of wood. The slight
figure was lifted tenderly from its resting place and
brought to Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch.</p>
<p>Since the last recollection of Nellie was when she
supposed her mother alive, it was deemed kinder that
she should not look upon the lifeless form again. With
hard labor the picks and shovels hollowed out a shallow
grave into which the form, wrapped about with a single
blanket, was laid away to rest until the last day.</p>
<p>The father, when questioned by the little one, explained
that her mother had gone on a long, long journey
and there was no saying when she would be seen
again. Nellie cried a good deal and it saddened her
parent&rsquo;s heart, when stealing softly into her room, he
saw the traces of tears on her cheeks. Who can tell the
sorrows of childhood when such a cruel affliction
comes upon it? But it is a blessed truth that time is
the healer of all wounds, and after awhile the little one
ceased to ask about her mother. When the whole truth
was told her, she had become old enough to bear the
blow.</p>
<p>Maurice Dawson&rsquo;s first purpose was to remain only
for a week or two with the friends of himself and child.
He had set out for the Pacific coast, and, although it
was still a thousand miles distant, he felt it his duty to
press on, but he suffered himself to be dissuaded, when
it was explained that the prospect of obtaining gold was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
as good at New Constantinople, whereas, if he continued
his journey, he would have to make his home
among strangers, who were not likely to feel the interest
in him and his child that was felt by those who were
the means of saving their lives. Furthermore, since he
had lost his team, he was without the means of pressing
on. None of the emigrant trains turned so far out of
their course as to come to Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch, and nothing
was plainer than that the citizens of that place
would not give the least help in an enterprise that was
to deprive them of Nellie. It is impossible to say what
would have followed, had he persisted in his first decision,
for while the men might have consented to let him
go, they would have rebelled had he attempted to take
the child from them.</p>
<p>And so it came about, we repeat, that Maurice Dawson
decided to make his home indefinitely in the town
that had been christened New Constantinople. With
the help of his neighbors, Landlord Ortigies divided his
rear room into two apartments, one of which was
turned over to the parent and his child. Nearly every
miner brought some article, such as a fragment of mirror,
a picture or trinket and presented it to the little one,
whose room naturally became the finest in New Constantinople.</p>
<p>Dawson himself joined the miners at their work, all
showing an eagerness to lend him a helping hand, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
there was reason to hope that in time there would be a
fair reward for their labor. He was not only an educated
man, but was strong and enterprising, considerate
of the feelings of others, and now that his life partner
was gone, he had but the little daughter to live for.
Gladly he toiled for her, for no child was ever more tenderly
loved by parent than she. His thoughts turned to
the future, but for some years he believed it was better
that she should remain where she was.</p>
<p>Nellie Dawson became the pet of the mining town.
There was not a man in the place, no matter how rough
his ways, nor how dark had been his past, who was not
made the better by her presence. She touched a responsive
chord in every heart. She awoke tones that
had been silent for years, and stirred into life resolves
that had lain dormant for a generation. When the
weather grew milder with the approach of spring, she
flitted like a bird from cabin to cabin, equally at home
and dearly prized in all. Many a time when night came,
the father was unable to find her, and perhaps saw nothing
of her until the next day, but he never felt any solicitude.
He knew that some of the men had persuaded
her to remain with them, and he was too considerate to
rob them of the pleasure of listening to her innocent
prattle, while they racked their ingenuity and threw
dignity to the winds in the effort to entertain her. Each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
one strove to make her think more of him than the others,
and it ended by her loving them all.</p>
<p>As a rule, Nellie ate her morning meal at home, after
spending the night with her father, and then she was
off for the day, returning or remaining away as her airy
fancy prompted. Her sweet influence in the mining
camp was beyond the power of human calculation to
fathom. No gauge could be placed upon it. Like the
sweep of an angel&rsquo;s wing, her coming seemed to have
wafted nearly all the coarseness, wrong and evil from
her path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a serious question that I want to lay afore
this company,&rdquo; gravely remarked Wade Ruggles one
night in the Heavenly Bower. Dawson was absent with
a brother miner at the lower end of the settlement, so
the gathering felt at liberty to discuss him and his child.
Wade of late had fallen into the habit of taking the
lead in such discussions, and Landlord Ortigies was
quite willing to turn over the honors of the chairmanship
to the outspoken fellow.</p>
<p>The remainder of the company were smoking, drinking
and talking as the mood took them, and all looked
inquiringly at the speaker, seeing which Wade continued
with the same earnestness he had shown at first:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this: that little angel that was tossed down
here in the blizzard is growing fast; she&rsquo;s larning something
cute every day; she notices things that you don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
think of; fact is she&rsquo;s the smartest youngster that was
ever born. Does any gent feel disposed to dispoot the
aforesaid statement?&rdquo; he abruptly asked, laying his
hand on the butt of his revolver and looking severely
around in the faces of his friends.</p>
<p>No one questioned the assertion. Had it been left to
them to choose the words, they would have made them
stronger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, the remark I was about to remark is that I
hear some coarse observations once in awhile. I may
say that I have indulged in a few myself when the &rsquo;casion
was suitable and called for &rsquo;em, but I want to give
notice that the thing must stop in the presence of the
angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your suggestions generally ain&rsquo;t worth listenin&rsquo;
to,&rdquo; observed Ike Hoe, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s solid sense in them
words. I have been troubled over the same thing and
was goin&rsquo; to submit a proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a purty one to do it,&rdquo; commented Vose
Adams scornfully; &ldquo;why it&rsquo;s only yesterday that I
heerd you say &lsquo;darn&rsquo; just because I happened to smash
the end of your finger, with the hammer I was drivin&rsquo;
a nail with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the little one hear him?&rdquo; asked Wade Ruggles,
while an expression of horror settled on every
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; declared Ike; &ldquo;afore I indulged in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
expression, so proper under the tryin&rsquo; circumstances, I
looked round to make sartin she wasn&rsquo;t in hearing distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have looked very quick,&rdquo; said Vose; &ldquo;for
the horrible words was simultaneous with the flattenin&rsquo;
of your big forefinger. Howsumever, I gazed round
myself and am happy to say she warn&rsquo;t in sight. If she
had been, I&rsquo;d smashed all your fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very proper Christian spirit,&rdquo; commended
Wade; &ldquo;I hope all the rest of you will strive to emerlate
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Felix Brush was leaning on the end of the bar with
a glass of steaming toddy, which he had partly sipped,
and was now caressing with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he impressively, &ldquo;permit me a
word. Wade has touched a subject which appeals to us
all. I have given it much thought for the past few days
and feel it my duty to look after the religious instruction
of the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three disrespectful snickers followed this declaration.
The parson instantly flared up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any reprobate here feels a desire to scoff, he&rsquo;s
only to step outside for a few minutes and see who can
get the drop on the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody knew that the parson was always well
heeled, and no one questioned his courage. His friends
contented themselves with pitying smiles and significant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
glances at one another. Felix hastily swallowed
his toddy, with the evident intention of airing his emphatic
views, when Wade Ruggles interposed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pards, you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; off the track; we hain&rsquo;t got
to the religious racket yit; that&rsquo;ll come later. What I
want to &rsquo;rive at is as to using cuss words and unproper
language where the angel hears it. It ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;nough for
us to agree that we won&rsquo;t do it; it must be fixed so we
don&rsquo;t take no chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not exactly clear and Wade was asked to be
more explicit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that there must be a penalty, such as will
stop a galoot that has once offended from doing the
same thing again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This clearly intimated that the punishment which the
chairman had in mind was of a frightful nature. The
landlord begged Wade to come down to particulars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idee is that whoever offends this little one by
unproper language shall be filled full of bullet holes:
how does <i>that</i> strike you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hits me just right!&rdquo; responded the landlord,
with several nods of his head; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s one thing
in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Wade, showing some
temper at this attack upon his scheme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It &rsquo;lows a man to say the unproper words in the
hearin&rsquo; of the angel, <i>afore</i> he&rsquo;s shot; so it won&rsquo;t prevent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
her ears from being &rsquo;fended. Can&rsquo;t we fix it some way,
so that she shan&rsquo;t hear &rsquo;em at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no trouble about that,&rdquo; solemnly remarked
Budge Isham from his seat at the further end of the
room; &ldquo;You have only to find out when a fellow has
made up his mind to use improper language in the
presence of the child, and then shoot him before he can
say the words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how shall we know he&rsquo;s going to say &rsquo;em?&rdquo; inquired
the chairman, who in the earnestness of his feelings
felt no suspicion of the honesty of his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to judge that by the expression of
his countenance. I think when a fellow has made up
his mind to swear his looks give notice of what is coming.
The rest of us must be on the alert and pick him
off before the words get out of his mouth. And yet I
am sorry to say,&rdquo; added Budge gravely rising to his
feet, &ldquo;that there is one serious drawback to my proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chairman is anxious to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be mistakes made. A man&rsquo;s expression
is not always an index of his thoughts. He might
be suffering from some inward pain, and be in the act
of uttering some expression, but his face could have so
mean a look that if our law was in force, he would be
shot on sight. For instance, studying these faces all
turned toward me, I should say, speaking on general
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
principles, that all except one or two deserve, not shooting,
but hanging, and if looks were to determine a
man&rsquo;s depth of infamy, mighty few of you would live
five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Budge sank gravely into his seat and resumed smoking,
while his friends, understanding his trifling character,
contemptuously refused attention to his disrespectful
remarks. In the general discussion which followed,
several insisted that the only proper punishment
for the grave offence was death; but the sentiment crystallized
into the feeling that that penalty was somewhat
severe for the first breaking of the law. It was proper
enough for the second crime, but a man who had been
accustomed to picturesque and emphatic words was
liable to err once at least while on the road to reformation.
The agreement finally reached was that the offender
should be heavily fined, compelled to fast several
days, or, more frightful than all, be deprived of the
privileges of the bar for the same length of time. When
the last penalty was fixed there were several suppressed
groans and a general setting of lips, with the unshakable
resolve to steer clear of that appalling punishment.</p>
<p>Everything was serene for several days, when, as
might have been anticipated, the explosion came. Al
Bidwell, in coming out of the Heavenly Bower, caught
the toe of one of his boots and fell forward on his hands
and knees. Two of his friends seeing him naturally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
laughed, whereupon, as he picked himself up, he demanded
in the name of the presiding genius of hades,
what they saw to laugh at. By way of answer, one
of them pointed to Nellie Dawson, who ran forward to
help him to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hurt yourself, Mr. Bidwell? I&rsquo;s so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well be, little one,&rdquo; was the bitter response,
as he realized his awful offence; &ldquo;for this will
play thunder with me&ndash;&ndash;there it goes agin! Please
don&rsquo;t say another word,&rdquo; he exclaimed desperately,
striding down the street to save himself from piling up
a mountain of unpardonable crimes.</p>
<p>The committee did not gather until late that evening,
for Nellie was at home and it was thought advisable to
wait until she was asleep, so that she should not know
anything of what was in the air. The conversation was
in subdued tones until Mr. Dawson tip-toed out of the
rear room, with the announcement that the little one
was sunk in slumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such bein&rsquo; the case,&rdquo; remarked Wade Ruggles,
with becoming gravity, &ldquo;this meeting will proceed to
bus&rsquo;ness. Pards, a hein&rsquo;us crime has been committed
among us. In the proud history of New Constantinople,
we&rsquo;ve had hangin&rsquo; bees; we&rsquo;ve shot three Injins
&rsquo;cause they <i>was</i> Injins; there has been any number of
holes plugged inter them as was a little careless of
speech, and more&rsquo;n once there has been the devil to pay,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
but nothin&rsquo; like this, <i>never</i>! Vose Adams, you was one
as heard this wretch Bidwell indulge in his shocking
profanity. You&rsquo;ll be good &rsquo;nough to give the partic&rsquo;lars
to the gents that I must warn to brace themselves fur
the shock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vose Adams told the story which was familiar to
all. He and Budge Isham were approaching the Heavenly
Bower that forenoon, the cause being a due regard
for the requirement of the laws of health, when Albert
Bidwell, the accused, stubbed his toe. Hearing a
laugh, he looked up and demanded to know what the
&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; they were laughing at. While the query, though
objectionable on &aelig;sthetic grounds, might have passed
muster in the diggings or anywhere in New Constantinople
previous to the advent of the angel at present
making her home with them, yet the horror of the thing
was that the aforesaid angel heard it. She ran to the
help of the villain, who added to his monumental crime
by calmly remarking to her that what he had just said
would play thunder with him.</p>
<p>This second offence was unanimously felt by those
present to be more unpardonable than the first, since it
was in the nature of an addendum, had nothing to do
with the business proper, and worst of all, was addressed
to Nellie herself.</p>
<p>Chairman Ruggles turned his severest frown upon
the prisoner, who was sitting disconsolately on a box,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
and drawing at his brier wood pipe, which in the depth
of his emotion, he failed to notice was unlighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has the prisoner to say fur himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bidwell shuffled to his feet, took the pipe from his
mouth and looked around upon the cold, unsympathetic
faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, pards,&rdquo; he remarked, heaving a great sigh,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s anything partic&rsquo;lar fur me to
say. When a thing is fairly proved onto you, you can&rsquo;t
make nothin&rsquo; by denyin&rsquo; of the same. I&rsquo;ve been tryin&rsquo;
to walk a chalk line ever since the angel arrove among
us. Two or three times I fell over backward and
bruised my head, owin&rsquo; to my tryin&rsquo; to stand up too
straight. I was just bracin&rsquo; myself to do the same
as aforesaid, when comin&rsquo; out of this disgraceful place,
when I took a headlong dive and struck the earth so
hard, I must have made a bulge in China. Two unmannerly
ijuts that happened to see me, instead of expressin&rsquo;
sorrer for my mishap, broke out laughin&rsquo;, and
in my righteous indignation, I asked them a emphatic
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ord&rsquo;narily,&rdquo; observed the Court, &ldquo;your explanation
would do. In the old times, nothin&rsquo; would have
been said if you&rsquo;d drawed your gun and give &rsquo;em a
lesson in manners, but that aint the question afore the
house: Why did you do it in the presence of the
angel?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see her till after the crime was committed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you look fur her to larn whether
she was in sight or was liable to hear your shocking
words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your reply only aggervates the offence. If any
man feels that he must swear or bust, he must bust,
purvided the little one is in sight; or he must hold in till
he can climb on top of the rocks, or creep among the
foothills where he&rsquo;s sure of being alone. The Court
hain&rsquo;t any &rsquo;bjection to your thinking all the cuss words
you want to, but you mus&rsquo;n&rsquo;t speak &rsquo;em when she&rsquo;s
about. You understand the position of the Court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a fool if I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; growled the accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s onnecessary to understand &rsquo;em in order to be
a fool, Mr. Bidwell, but how &rsquo;bout your second offence,
when you used the word &lsquo;thunder,&rsquo; and addressed it to
the gal herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner felt that nothing could be said in palliation
of this charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>was</i> bad bus&rsquo;ness, I&rsquo;ll confess; but I was so
disgusted with myself that I didn&rsquo;t know what I was
doing or saying; the words come out afore I had time
to pull myself together. I was so afeard of adding
something still worser that I just rushed off to git out
of danger.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where you showed the first grain of sense
the Court ever knowed you to show. If I had been in
your place, I would have jumped off the rocks, into the
kenyon, two thousand feet below. If you&rsquo;d done that
you&rsquo;d been saved the disgrace of being put on trial in
this honorable Court. Gents,&rdquo; added Ruggles, glancing
from the prisoner into the expectant faces, &ldquo;since
the man owns up, it rests with you to fix the penalty for
his crime of bigamous murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner resumed his seat and the chairman
looked around, as an invitation for those present to express
their views. When they came to do so, a wide
diversity came to the surface. Vose Adams suggested
that the criminal be compelled to go without any food
for three days, but this was not favorably received,
since the rough, trying life which each man had been
compelled to follow at times during the past years,
made the punishment much less than it appeared to be.</p>
<p>Ike Hoe suggested that instead of food, the accused&rsquo;s
liquid refreshment should be shut off for the time
named. The accused groaned.</p>
<p>When this had continued for some time, Felix Brush,
the parson, took the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, it&rsquo;s a principle in law to be lenient with
the first offence, and, since this is the first time that Bidwell
has offended and he deeply feels his disgrace, why
not require him to apologize to the young lady and
stand treat for the crowd, with the understanding that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
his next crime shall be visited with condign punishment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you propose to let him off?&rdquo; demanded the
wrathful chairman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; for this once, but never again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never consent to anything of the kind! The
dignity of the Court must be preserved; the law must
be executed, and any man who says &lsquo;devil&rsquo; or &lsquo;thunder&rsquo;
in the presence of the little gal, I don&rsquo;t care what
the circumstances, orter to be shot, so that there wont
be any delay in his going to the devil, where he belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>O, Mr. Ruggles, I heard you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little figure dressed in white stood at the door
leading to the rear room, and the startled auditors turning
their heads, saw Nellie Dawson, with her chubby
finger pointed reprovingly at the dumbfounded chairman.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>SUITING THE PUNISHMENT TO THE CRIME</h3>
</div>
<p>Wade Ruggles was speechless. He sat with his
mouth wide open and his eyes staring at the little figure,
as if it were a veritable apparition. All the others
looked in the same direction. Nellie Dawson stood
for a moment with her finger pointed reprovingly at the
chairman, and then turning about ran back into the
rear room and plunged into her bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max, quick!&rdquo; said Ruggles faintly, pointing to the
black bottle at the rear of the bar. The landlord hastily
poured out some of the fiery stuff, and the miserable
fellow swallowed it at a gulp. It served partly to revive
him, but he was really on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>The only one of the company not impressed was
Maurice Dawson, father of the little girl. He was sitting
well back of the rest, where no one paid attention
to him. Comprehending the meaning of this incident,
he drew his hand across his mouth to conceal the smile
that could not be wholly restrained. Then he hurried
back into the room to see that his child was &ldquo;tucked
up&rdquo; and properly covered for the night. Finding himself
in the dark, where he could not be observed, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
laughed deeply and silently, his mirth all the greater
because of the oppressive gravity of every one else.
Then bending over, he said, as he kissed the little one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were asleep, Nellie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was, but Mr. Ruggles spoke those bad words
so loud he woked me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t get up again, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you don&rsquo;t want me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just told you I don&rsquo;t wish you to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wont get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father lingered in the room, until he mastered
his disposition to laugh, and then, when he walked out
among his friends no countenance was graver than
his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Dawson,&rdquo; said Ruggles, swallowing a lump
in his throat, &ldquo;will you oblige me by acting as chairman?&ndash;&ndash;I
don&rsquo;t feel&ndash;&ndash;very&ndash;&ndash;well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman walked forward to where Ruggles
had been standing with his back against the bar, looking
down in the faces of his friends. The poor fellow
seemed to have aged ten years, as he slouched off to an
upturned box near the door, where he dejectedly seated
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your pleasure, gentlemen?&rdquo; asked Dawson,
as if presiding over the deliberations of one of the
most august assemblages in the land; &ldquo;I am ready to
hear any suggestion or motion.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>Al Bidwell rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I wish to endorse with all my heart,
the soul-stirring, eloquent address to which we have
just listened from the late Mr. Ruggles,&ndash;&ndash;I mean the
late Chairman. Them sentiments of his is as sound as
a gold dollar. He maintains that any gent that uses
an unproper word, such as he used and which I scorn
to repeat, in the presence of the young lady, who has
just listened to his remarks, oughter to be sent to the
individooal whose name is too shocking fur me to pronounce,
since the aforesaid young lady is in the adjoining
apartment, from whence she was awoke by the awful
profanity of the gent who lately served as our chairman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And having gotten back on Ruggles in this masterly
manner, Bidwell sat down, slung one leg over the other,
and relit his pipe. The oppressive silence was broken
by a prodigious sigh from Ruggles.</p>
<p>Parson Brush, after the stillness had continued some
minutes, rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, an extraordinary state of affairs
has arisen. You have not forgotten that I plead for
charity for Mr. Bidwell, because it was his first offence.
My plea was not well received, but my sentiments
are unchanged, and I now make the same plea
for Mr. Ruggles and on the same grounds. When
he was denouncing in fitting terms the sin of Bidwell,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
he had no thought of committing the crime himself,
but in his earnestness he did. This being plain to all
of us, I renew&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wade Ruggles bounded to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any one to plead for me! I ain&rsquo;t
pleading fur myself! I can take my medicine like a
man; if there&rsquo;s any galoot here&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly checked himself with an apprehensive
glance at the door of the rear room, and then resumed
in a more subdued voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I insist that Al Bidwell shall suffer for his onspeakable
crime and me too, &rsquo;cause mine was onspeakabler.
Jedgin&rsquo; from the evidence that showed itself,
I must have awoke the little gal from peaceful slumber,
by them awful words of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and looked inquiringly at the chairman,
who calmly returned his gaze, without speaking. It
was Parson Brush who interposed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to ask, Mr. Dawson, whether the supposition
of Mr. Ruggles has any foundation in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has; when I asked Nellie what caused her to
awake, she said it was Mr. Ruggles when he used those
bad words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I thought!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruggles, as if he
enjoyed heaping fire upon his own head; &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t
any depth of infamy which I hain&rsquo;t reached. For me
to try to sneak out now, when I made such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
a&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;(Here he again threw a startled glance at the rear of
the room) would be to do something which Wade Ruggles
never done in his variegated career of nigh onto
forty years. All I ask is that you&rsquo;ll git through it as
soon as you kin and fix our terms of imprisonment or
our deaths and hev done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al Bidwell took an unworthy delight in prodding the
man who had been so severe upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg humbly to suggest to the gent that there are
plenty of places in the mountains where he can make
a jump of a thousand feet or two into the kenyons.
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idee fur the gent to try it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will if you&rsquo;ll join me,&rdquo; retorted Wade, turning
upon him like a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you try it first and see how it works,&rdquo; replied
Bidwell, so crushed that he remained silent henceforward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I am chairman,&rdquo; said Dawson, with becoming
dignity, &ldquo;it is my duty to listen to suggestions and
to hear motions. What is your pleasure, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one in looking at the countenance of Maurice
Dawson would have suspected he was extracting the
keenest enjoyment from these proceedings, yet such
was the fact. There was something so intensely ludicrous
in the whole business, that only by assuming
preternatural gravity could he refrain from breaking
into merriment. His policy was to egg on the discussion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
until the company were ready for a decision, when
he would interpose with the proposal to wipe out the
whole matter and begin over again. The earnestness
of Wade Ruggles, however, threatened to check anything
of that nature. He was on his feet several times
until Budge Isham, who shrewdly suspected the sentiments
of the chairman, protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all due respect to the parson, to Ruggles and
to Bidwell, it strikes me, Mr. Chairman, that they
should give the rest of us a show. We have listened
to their yawping until it has grown monotonous. Having
told us a dozen times, more or less, that he wants
us to punish him all he deserves, Mr. Ruggles ought
to let it rest with that; but he shouldn&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; added
Budge, with the solemn manner which always marked
his waggery, &ldquo;that, if we took him at his word, he
would be kicking vacancy this minute. However, this
hasn&rsquo;t anything to do with his general cussedness, but
concerns his offence against the young lady. That is
all there is before the house, and I insist that we confine
ourselves to that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what I&rsquo;ve been insistin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; demanded
Wade Ruggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go again! I have the floor, and you
have no parliamentary right to interrupt me with your
frivolous remarks. Am I correct, Mr. Chairman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are most unquestionably; proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to bring this tiresome matter to a close, I
move that Mr. Bidwell be deprived of the bar privileges
of the Heavenly Bower for a period of four days, and
that the same be denied to Mr. Ruggles for a period of
one week. Did I hear a groan?&rdquo; asked Budge, looking
round at the two men, who were trying bravely to
bear up under the threatened punishment.</p>
<p>Both shook their heads, afraid to trust their voices
by way of reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the gentlemen will permit me,&rdquo; said the chairman,
&ldquo;I should like to say a few words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure we shall be glad to hear from Mr. Dawson,&rdquo;
remarked the parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. What I had in mind is this:&ndash;&ndash;It is
creditable to your honor that you should pledge yourselves
to refrain from unbecoming language in the
hearing of my little girl, for you cannot help being her
instructors, no matter how much you may wish it were
otherwise. But you are magnifying the matter. I am
sure every man of you will strive just as hard, without
being incited thereto by the fear of punishment. I would
beg to suggest&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, for, looking at Wade Ruggles, he saw
it was useless to go further. Bidwell would have been
glad to receive leniency, but his partner in crime was
immovable, and it would not do to punish one and allow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
the other to go free. Dawson was wise enough
to accept the situation promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard the penalties suggested for the offences
of the two gentlemen accused. All who favor
such punishment will show it by raising their right
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every man in the room, except the chairman, voted
in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t worth while to put the negative. The accused
have heard the verdict, which is that Mr. Bidwell
shall not drink a drop of anything except water or coffee
for a period of four days, dating from this moment,
while Mr. Ruggles is to undergo the same penalty for
a period of one week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; growled Bidwell; &ldquo;for he drank
about half of what was in the bottle only a few minutes
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would have drunk it all,&rdquo; retorted Ruggles,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;d knowed what was coming.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A HUNDRED FOLD</h3>
</div>
<p>All this may seem a trifling matter to the reader
who does not understand the real punishment suffered
by these two men, who, like all the rest of their companions,
had been accustomed to the use of ardent
spirits for many years. There was no deprivation
which they could not have borne with less distress, but
their great consolation was that both knew the penalty
was fully deserved, and they would not have complained
had it been made more severe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Bidwell, at the end of the fourth
day, when he had celebrated his release from purgatory,
&ldquo;it pays, Ruggles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What pays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reward you git for all this. At the end of a
week you&rsquo;ll have a thirst that you wouldn&rsquo;t take a thousand
dollars fur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the week isn&rsquo;t much more&rsquo;n half gone and I&rsquo;d
sell my thirst mighty cheap now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it! Hold fast to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing, &rsquo;cause I can&rsquo;t help myself.
Howsumever it&rsquo;s the thirst that&rsquo;s holding fast to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beauty of it; it&rsquo;ll git stronger and
stronger, and then it&rsquo;s so big that you can&rsquo;t well handle
it. It seems to me that ten minutes after I&rsquo;ve had a
drink, I&rsquo;m thirsty agin, which reminds me; I&rsquo;d like to
invite you, Wade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Invite all you want to, &rsquo;cause it won&rsquo;t do any more
hurt than good; don&rsquo;t let me keep you,&rdquo; added Ruggles,
observing the longing eyes his friend cast in the
direction of the Heavenly Bower. Bidwell moved off
with pretended reluctance, out of consideration for the
feelings of his friend, but once inside, he gave another
demonstration of the truth of his remarks concerning
thirst.</p>
<p>As for Ruggles, only he who has been similarly placed
can appreciate his trial. No man is so deserving of
sympathy as he who is making a resolute effort to conquer
the debasing appetite that has brought him to the
gutter.</p>
<p>On that fourth night the thirst of the fellow was a
raging fever. He drank copious draughts of spring
water, but all the help it gave was to fill him up. The
insatiate craving remained and could not be soothed.
It seemed as if every nerve was crying out for the
stimulant which it was denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only time I ever went through anything like
this,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;was twenty years ago, when
a party of us were lost in the Death Valley. Three of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
&rsquo;em died of thirst, and I come so nigh it that it makes
me shudder to think of it even at this late day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wonderful experience came to Wade Ruggles.
To his unbounded amazement, he noticed a sensible
diminution, on the fifth day, of his thirst. It startled
him at first and caused something in the nature of
alarm. He feared some radical change had taken place
in his system which threatened a dangerous issue.
When this misgiving passed, it was succeeded by something
of the nature of regret. One consoling reflection
from the moment his torture began, was the reward
which Al Bidwell had named, that is,&ndash;&ndash;the glorious enjoyment
of fully quenching his terrific craving, but, if
that craving diminished, the future bliss must shrink
in a corresponding ratio, and <i>that</i> was a calamity to
make a man like him shudder.</p>
<p>On the evening of the fifth day, he ventured for the
first time during his penal term, to enter the Heavenly
Bower. He wished to test his self-control. When he
sat quietly and saw his friends imbibing, and was yet
able to restrain himself from a headlong rush to join
them, he knew that beyond all question, his fearful appetite
had lost a part of its control over him. Still he
believed it was only a temporary disarrangement, and
that the following day would bring a renewal of his
thirst, with all its merciless violence.</p>
<p>But lo! on the sixth morning, the appetite was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
weaker than ever. His craving was so moderate that,
after a deep draught of mountain spring water, he was
hardly conscious of any longing for liquor. He seemed
to be losing his memory of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; he mused, keeping the astonishing
truth to himself; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s less than a week ago
that I was one of the heaviest drinkers in New Constantinople,
and if anyone had told me of this, I would
have been sure he&rsquo;d lost his senses, which the same may
be what&rsquo;s the matter with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no awakening of his torment during
the day, and when he lay down at night, he was disturbed
by strange musings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had a doctor in the place, I would ask him to
tell me what it means. The queerest thing &rsquo;bout the
whole bus&rsquo;ness is that I feel three thousand per cent.
better. I wonder if it can be on &rsquo;count of my not swallerin&rsquo;
any of Ortigies&rsquo; pison which the same he calls
Mountain Dew. I guess it must be that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that night he was restless, and gradually his
thoughts turned into a new channel. A momentous
problem presented itself for solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve improved so much after goin&rsquo; six days without
drinkin&rsquo;, won&rsquo;t I feel a blamed sight better, if I try
it for six weeks&ndash;&ndash;six months&ndash;&ndash;six years&ndash;&ndash;<i>forever</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as an extraordinary, a marvelous resolution
simmered and finally crystallized, he chortled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll the boys say? What&rsquo;ll the parson think?
What&rsquo;ll I think? What would that good old mother of
mine think, if she was alive? But she died afore she
knowed what a good for nothin&rsquo; man her boy turned
out to be. God rest her soul!&rdquo; he added softly, &ldquo;she
must have prayed over me a good many hundred times;
if she&rsquo;s kept track of me all these years, this is an
answer to her prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Budge Isham was the partner of Wade, and shared
his cabin with him. He slept across the room, and
noticed how his friend tossed and muttered in his sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Gee!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;but Wade&rsquo;s got it
pretty bad; I wonder if it&rsquo;s the jim jams that is getting
hold of him; I&rsquo;ll sleep with one eye open, for he will
need looking after. What a blessed thing it is that he
has only one more day. Then he can celebrate and be
happy. I have no doubt that by the end of another
week, he will have brought things up to their old average.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this conclusion, the man who a few years
before took the first honors at Yale, shifted his position,
so as to keep an eye on his comrade, and straightway
proceeded to drop into a sound slumber, which was not
broken until the sun rose on the following morning.</p>
<p>The sympathy for Wade was general. Had he not
insisted upon carrying out in spirit and letter the full
punishment pronounced upon him, there would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
been a unanimous agreement to commute his term by
one or two days at least; but all knew the grit or
&ldquo;sand&rdquo; of the fellow too well to propose it.</p>
<p>His actions on the seventh day caused considerable
disquietude. He had labored in the mines, in a desultory
fashion up to that time, but he did not do a stroke
of work during the concluding hours of his ordeal. It
was observed by his partner, Budge Isham, that his
appetite was unusually good and he seemed to be in
high spirits. His friends attributed this to the closeness
of his reward for his abstention, but he took several
walks up the mountain side and was gone for a good
while. He wore a smiling face and Vose Adams declared
that he overheard him communing with himself,
when he thought he was too far off for the act to be noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use of talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; whispered Vose; &ldquo;Wade ain&rsquo;t
quite himself; he&rsquo;s a little off and won&rsquo;t be exactly right
till after two or three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has my sympathy,&rdquo; remarked the parson, &ldquo;but
it will serve as a lesson which he will always remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And won&rsquo;t <i>we</i> remember it?&rdquo; said Ike Hoe, with
a shudder. &ldquo;When we&rsquo;re disposed to say one of them
unproper words, the picture of that miserable scamp
going a full week without a touch of Mountain Dew,
will freeze up our lips closer than a clam.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>That night the usual group was gathered at the
Heavenly Bower. There were the same merry jests,
the reminiscences, the conjectures how certain diggings
would pan out, the small talk and the general good feeling.
Common hardship and suffering had brought these
rough men close to one another. They were indulgent
and charitable and each one would have eagerly risked
his life for the sake of the rest. Quick to anger, they
were equally quick to forgive, mutually rejoicing in
good fortune, and mutually sympathetic in sorrow.</p>
<p>There was more than one furtive glance at Ruggles,
who was among the first arrivals. Whispers had
passed around of his strange actions, and the surprise
would not have been great had it been found that he
had gone clean daft; but nothing in his manner indicated
anything of that nature. He was as full of quip
and jest as ever, and none was in higher or more buoyant
spirits than he.</p>
<p>He suddenly called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dawson, what time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latest comer among them carried a watch which
he drew out and examined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is exactly half-past nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did my punishment begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week ago to-night, precisely at this hour; I began
to fear that you had forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of my ever forgetting it,&rdquo; grimly responded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Ruggles; &ldquo;what I want to know is whether I
have served out my full term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have unquestionably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anyone here disposed to dispute this statement?&rdquo;
asked Wade, standing very erect and looking
around in the faces of his friends.</p>
<p>No one interposed an objection. He had not only
the sympathy but the respect of every one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sarved your time like a man,&rdquo; remarked Ike
Hoe; &ldquo;the week is up and you&rsquo;ve give good measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which the same being the case, I invite all to come
forward and liquidate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never was an invitation responded to with more enthusiasm.
The grinning Ortigies set out a couple of
bottles, intending as a matter of course to join in the
celebration. He feelingly remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wade, my heart bled for you and thar ain&rsquo;t a pard
here that wouldn&rsquo;t have been willing to take your place&ndash;&ndash;that
is for a limited time,&rdquo; the landlord hastened to
add.</p>
<p>Each tumbler was half-filled with the fiery stuff and
all looked in smiling expectancy at their host to give the
cue. He poured a small quantity into his glass, and
elevating it almost to a level with his lips, looked over
the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready, pards? here goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up went every glass and down went the stuff. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
there was one exception. While the glass was at his
lips, and while the familiar odor was in his nostrils,
Wade Ruggles deliberately inverted the tumbler and
emptied the contents on the floor.</p>
<p>It was the strangest incident that had ever occurred
in New Constantinople.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>TEACHER AND PUPIL</h3>
</div>
<p>The group looked at Wade Ruggles in breathless
amazement. He had invited them to the bar to join in
celebrating his release from thralldom; all had filled
their glasses and he had raised his own to his lips,
though several noticed that there was only a small
amount of liquid in the tumbler. Then, when every
glass was upraised and there was a general gurgling,
he had turned his glass upside down and spilled every
drop on the floor.</p>
<p>Before anyone could think of suitable terms in which
to express his emotions, Wade said, with a smile that
rather added than detracted from his seriousness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pards, never again does a drop of that stuff go
down my throat! I&rsquo;ve suffered hell, but I&rsquo;ve come out
of the flames, and the one that fetched me through is
the little gal which lays asleep in the next room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not attempt to deliver a temperance lecture
to his friends, nor did they trifle with him. They
questioned him closely as to how he had reached this
extraordinary decision, and he gave a vivid and truthful
account of his experience. It made several of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
men thoughtful, but most of them felt dubious about his
persistence in the new path he had laid out for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, boys, whether I&rsquo;ve got a will of my
own,&rdquo; he quietly replied; &ldquo;just wait and see how this
thing comes out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was noticed that Parson Brush was the most interested
inquirer, and, though he had comparatively
little to say, he left the Bower unusually early. He had
begun his system of instruction with Nellie Dawson,
and reported that she was making remarkably good
progress. Had the contrary been the fact, it may be
doubted whether it would have been safe for him to
proclaim it.</p>
<p>And now the scene changes. It is the close of a radiant
summer day in the Sierras. Far down in the
ca&ntilde;on-like chasm between the mountainous spurs,
nestled the little mining settlement, which had been
christened but a short time before, New Constantinople.
Here and there tiny wounds had been gouged into
the ribs of the mountain walls, and the miners were
pecking away with pick and shovel, deepening the hurts
in their quest for the yellow atoms or dark ore which
had been the means of bringing every man thousands
of miles to the spot.</p>
<p>Far up toward the clouds were the towering, craggy
peaks, with many a rent and yawn and table-land and
lesser elevation, until, as if to check the climbing ambition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
of the prodigious monster, nature had flung an immense
blanket of snow, whose ragged and torn edges
lapped far down the sides of the crests. Ages ago the
chilling blanket was tucked around the mountain tops,
there to remain through the long stretch of centuries
to follow.</p>
<p>Down the valley, at the bottom of the winding ca&ntilde;on,
the air palpitated with the fervor of the torrid zone.
He who attempted to plod forward panted and perspired,
but a little way up the mountain side, the cool
breath crept downward from the regions of perpetual
ice and snow, through the balsamic pines and cedars,
with a revivifying power that was grateful to all who
felt its life-giving embrace.</p>
<p>The sun hovered in a sky of unclouded azure. It
shot its arrows into the gullies, ravines and gorges, but
made no impression on the frozen covering far up in
cloudland itself. Long pointed ravelings on the lower
edge of the mantle showed where some of the snow had
turned to water, which changed again to ice, when the
sun dipped below the horizon.</p>
<p>The miners were pigmies as they toiled in the sides
of the towering mountain walls, where they had toiled
for many a day. On the lip of a projecting crag, half
a mile above were three other pigmies, who neither
toiled nor spun. Viewed through a glass, it was seen
that they wore stained feathers in their black hair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
dangling about their shoulders, with the blankets wrapped
round their forms descending to their moccasined
feet. They were watching in grim silence these proofs
of the invasion of their homes by the children of another
race, and mayhap were conjuring some scheme for
driving them back into the great sea across which they
had sailed to occupy the new land.</p>
<p>One of the Indians was a chieftain. He had come in
violent contact with these hated creatures and he bore
on his person the scars of such meeting. All carried
bows and arrows, though others of their tribe had
learned the use of the deadly firearms, which has played
such havoc with the American race.</p>
<p>Suddenly the chief uttered an exclamation. Then
drawing an arrow from the quiver over his shoulder,
he fitted it to the string of his long bow,
and pointing downward toward the group of
miners, launched the shaft. Except for the power of
gravity, it would have been a foolhardy effort, but
guided by the wisp of feather twisted around the reed,
the missile spun far outward over the ca&ntilde;on, and dived
through the vast reach of space, as if it were endowed
with life and determined to seek out and pierce the
intruders. The black eyes of the three warriors followed
the arrow until it was only a flickering speck, far
below them; but, before that moment arrived, they saw
that it was speeding wide of the mark. When at last,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the sharp point struck the flinty rock, and the missile
doubled over upon itself and dropped harmlessly to the
bottom of the ca&ntilde;on, it was at such a distance from the
miners, that they knew nothing of it. They never
looked up, nor were they aware of the futile anger of
the red men, who seeing how useless was everything
of that nature, turned about and soon passed from
view.</p>
<p>The incident was typical of the futility of the red
man struggling against his inevitable doom at the
hands of his white brother.</p>
<p>Half way between the bottom of the ca&ntilde;on and the
lower fringe of the vast mantle of snow, a waterfall
tumbled over the edge of a rock, and with many a twist
and eddy found its way to the small stream, which rippled
along the bottom of the gorge, until its winding
course carried it beyond sight. Now and then a rift of
wind blew aside some of the foam, like a wisp of snow,
and brought the murmur more clearly to the ear of the
listener, shutting out for the time, the faint hollow roar
that was wafted from the region of pines and cedars. It
was a picture of lonely grandeur and desolation, made
all the more impressive by the tiny bits of life, showing
in the few spots along the mountain wall.</p>

THE TEACHER HAD MARKED ON THE DARK FACE OF THE ROCK WITH A SPECIES OF CHALK ALL THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET.&ndash;&ndash;PAGE 71.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>At the rear of the row of cabins, and elevated perhaps
fifty feet above, was the comparatively smooth
face of a rock, several square rods in extent. At the
base was abundant footing for two persons, Parson
Brush and Nellie Dawson. The teacher had marked
on the dark face of the rock with a species of chalk,
all the letters large and small of the alphabet. They
were well drawn, for the parson, like others in the settlement,
was a man of education, though his many
years of roughing it had greatly rusted his book knowledge.</p>
<p>Standing to one side of his artistic work, like a
teacher of the olden time, the parson, with a long,
trimmed branch in his hand, pointed at the different
letters in turn and patiently waited for his little pupil
to pronounce their names.</p>
<p>It never would have done to make the child keep her
feet like an ordinary mortal. With great labor, three
of the miners had carried a stone of considerable size
to the spot, which served her as a seat, while receiving
instruction. It is true that she never sat still for more
than three minutes at a time, but that was enough to
establish the indispensable necessity of a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are doing very well, my dear,&rdquo; said the parson,
encouragingly; &ldquo;you have received only a few lessons,
but have mastered the alphabet. I notice that the
&lsquo;d&rsquo;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;b&rsquo;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;h&rsquo;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;q&rsquo;s&rsquo; puzzle you a little
now and then, but you have got them straight, and it is
now time that we took a lesson in spelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t do that, Mr. Brush,&rdquo; protested the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
queen, rising from the chair, adjusting her skirts and
sitting down again; &ldquo;I never can spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it to spell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can best answer your question by showing you.
Have you ever seen a cat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean a pussy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; some folks call it that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; when we came from where we used to
live,&ndash;&ndash;I guess it must have been three or four hundred
years ago, we brought my pussy along. Her name was
Nellie, the same as mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She died,&rdquo; was the sorrowful reply; &ldquo;I guess she
was homesick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was too bad. Now will you tell me what letter
that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Brush, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I wish to find out whether you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is C; anybody knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right; now this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;T; I hope you will remember, Mr. Brush, because
I don&rsquo;t like to tell you so often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher continued to drill her, skipping about
and pointing at the letters so rapidly in turn that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
was kept bowing and straightening up like a jumping-jack.
Then, allowing her to rest, he pronounced the
letters in their regular order, giving them the sounds
proper to the word itself. Nellie, who was watching
closely and listening, suddenly exclaimed with glowing
face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s &lsquo;cat&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; now can you say the letters without
looking at them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After one or two trials she did it successfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! you have learned to spell &lsquo;cat.&rsquo; You see
how easy it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that spell &lsquo;pussy&rsquo; too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&ndash;&ndash;only &lsquo;cat.&rsquo; After a time you will be able to
spell big words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me try something else, Mr. Brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next word tackled was &lsquo;dog,&rsquo; which was soon
mastered. When this was accomplished, the teacher
paused for a moment. He was trying to think of another
word of three letters, but oddly enough could not
readily do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;here is another. Now give
me the name of that letter,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;M.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now say them quickly, &lsquo;d-a-m;&rsquo; what is the
word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;dam&rsquo;; O, Mr. Brush, I heard you say
that is a bad word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher was thunderstruck and stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that, but there are two kinds of
&lsquo;dam&rsquo; and this one is not a bad word. It means a
bank of earth or stones or wood, that is put up to stop
the flow of water.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3><span class='smcaplc'>PUPIL AND TEACHER</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Mr. Brush glanced nervously around, to learn
whether any of his friends were within hearing, shuddering
to think what the consequences might be. He
believed that he could explain the matter to some of the
folks, but the majority were so radical in their views
that they would refuse to admit the distinction, and
would take him to task for teaching improper language
to his young pupil. It caused him another shudder at
the thought that the same penalty that Wade Ruggles
had undergone might be visited upon him, though it is
doubtful if the issue would have been similar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem, Miss Nellie, when we go back home, will
you promise me to say nothing about this part of your
lesson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean &rsquo;bout that bad word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&ndash;&ndash;let&rsquo;s forget all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, but mebbe I&rsquo;ll forget to forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely enough,&rdquo; gloomily reflected the parson;
&ldquo;suppose we try some other words. Ah, we have a
visitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Budge Isham climbed into view and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
sauntered smilingly toward them. Brush added a
whispered warning to the little one not to forget her
promise, though, since Isham was an educated man,
there ought not to have been anything to fear in his
case, but the teacher knew his waggish nature, and had
good reason to fear the mischief he would delight in
creating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; was his cheery greeting, as he came up;
&ldquo;I hope I am not intruding, but I thought I should like
to see how you are getting on, Nellie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Brush says I am learning real fast; I can
spell &lsquo;cat,&rsquo; and &lsquo;dog,&rsquo; and &lsquo;dam.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Budge raised his hands in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of heaven, parson, does she
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Isham,&rdquo; said the gentleman, severely, &ldquo;are
you aware that you are using improper language in the
presence of this young lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wrong for you to appeal to heaven on so trifling
a question; it is such a near approach to profanity that
the dividing line is imperceptible. I am sorry you forgot
yourself, but I will overlook it this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Budge was really frightened, for though the distinction
was quite fine, he felt there was some justice in the
position of the parson, but he bluffed it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt whether a jury would find me guilty, and in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
the meantime explain the remark just made by Nellie,
if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus cornered, the parson made a clean breast of it.
Isham assumed a grave expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only criticism I can make is upon your taste in
selecting a word, susceptible of a questionable meaning.
You know as well as I that if this should be submitted
to a jury at the Heavenly Bower this evening, the
majority would sit down on you, and it would be hard
work for you to escape the penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it would,&rdquo; responded the parson; &ldquo;it
was a piece of forgetfulness on my part&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is the plea that Bidwell and Ruggles made,
but it didn&rsquo;t answer. However, I&rsquo;ll say nothing about it,
knowing you will be more careful in the future, while
I shall not forget to put a bridle on my own tongue.
The trouble, however,&rdquo; he added with a smile, &ldquo;is to
make <i>her</i> overlook it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has promised she will do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since that promise was made just before I got here,
she has shown how readily she can forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give her a longer lesson than usual and thus
drive all remembrance out of her mind,&rdquo; said the parson
resolutely.</p>
<p>Budge Isham folded his arms, prepared to look on
and listen, but the queen of the proceedings checked it
all by an unexpected veto.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brush, I feel so tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face wore a bored expression and she looked
wistfully away from the blackboard toward the cabins
below them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your head hurt you?&rdquo; inquired the teacher
with much solicitude, while the single auditor was
ready to join in the protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but mebbe it will hurt me one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t wise, parson, to force the child; a great deal
of injury is done to children by cramming their heads
with useless knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher could not feel sure that this counsel was
disinterested, for there could be no danger of his taxing
the mental powers of the little one too severely, but
her protest could not pass unheeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done very well, my child; you are learning
fast, so we&rsquo;ll leave the spelling for to-morrow.
Suppose we now try the commandments: can you repeat
the first one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nellie gave it correctly, as she did with slight assistance,
the remaining ones. She was certainly gifted
with a remarkable memory and possessed an unusually
bright mind. Budge Isham was impressed by her repetition
of the decalogue, whose meaning she was unable
fully to grasp. His frivolous disposition vanished, as
he looked upon the innocent child and watched the lips
from which the sacred words flowed. He quietly decided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
that it would be inexcusably mean to seek any
amusement at the expense of the parson, and it may as
well be added that he never afterward referred to the
incident, while it seemed to have passed wholly from
the mind of Nellie herself. At the conclusion of the
lesson, Budge complimented teacher and pupil and said
he would be glad to certify that Mr. Brush was the best
teacher in New Constantinople, and that it was impossible
for any one to take his place. Then he bade
them good day and walked thoughtfully away, leaving
them once more to themselves.</p>
<p>These were the most precious moments of all to the
teacher, when the formal lesson was completed, and he
sat down for a little talk with his pupil. He occupied
the stone which served her for a seat, while one arm
loosely clasped the figure which stood between his
knees. She patted his cheek, played with his rough collar
and shaggy whiskers, while as he listened and replied
to her prattle, felt as never before the truth of the
declaration that of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brush,&rdquo; she finally said, &ldquo;do you know why I
love you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it must be because I am so handsome,&rdquo; he
replied with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it isn&rsquo;t that, for you <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! but you are not afraid to speak the truth,
little one, and I hope you will always do that. No; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
don&rsquo;t know why you love me, unless you are so good
yourself that you can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not exactly clear to the little one, and she
stood silent for a minute, gently fingering his long
beard. Then she thought it best to clear up the mystery
without further parley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though the avowal was delightful, it caused a
pang, like a knife-thrust from his accusing conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thankful to hear you say that, but, Nellie, I
am not good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you is, but if you ain&rsquo;t good, why ain&rsquo;t you
good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The logic of the reply of the adult was of the same
grade as that of the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the true reason is because I am bad. I
am sorry to say it, but I have drifted far away from
where I ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dimpled hand continued to fondle the whiskers,
and the little brain was busy, but a wisdom that was
more than human guided it. Turning those lustrous
blue eyes upon him she softly asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do what I ask you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He almost gasped, for he instinctively suspected
what was coming, but he answered without hesitation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is my power I will do it, though it kills me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want it to kill you; this won&rsquo;t hurt you;
will you do it, Mr. Brush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, God helping me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do like Mr. Ruggles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the parson with a sinking
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drink any more of that red water, which
makes men talk loud and sometimes say bad words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; thought the parson; &ldquo;she little dreams
what she is asking me, but it is not she but some One
who is thus calling me back to duty. Yes, my child, I
will do what you ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You is as good and nice as you can be now, but
then you will be a good deal gooder and nicer,&rdquo; said
she, warmly kissing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; he added, rising to his feet, with the
feeling that he was not himself but some one else, and
that that some one else was the young man away among
the distant hills of Missouri, before he wandered to the
West, and in doing so, wandered from the path along
which he had attempted to guide and lead others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call myself her teacher,&rdquo; he mused, as he reached
down and took the tiny hand in his own, &ldquo;but she is
the teacher and I am the pupil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had started in the direction of the cabins, when
they heard curious shouts and outcries in that direction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something strange going on down there,&rdquo;
he said, peering toward the point; &ldquo;I wonder what it
can be; let us hurry and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Firmly clasping her hand, the two hastened down the
incline, wondering what it was that caused all the noise
and confusion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE PASSING YEARS</h3>
</div>
<p>THE excitement in New Constantinople was caused
by the arrival of Vose Adams, the mail carrier and messenger,
with his budget of letters and freight for the
Heavenly Bower.</p>
<p>These periodical journeys never occupied less than
two weeks, and in the present instance he had been absent
several days beyond that period, so that some
anxiety was felt for him, since every trip was attended
with more or less danger. He was exposed to the peril
of storms, snowslides, wild animals and hostile Indians.
The elemental disturbances in the Sierras are sometimes
of a terrific nature. Twice he had lost a mule, and
once both animals went spinning down a precipice for
a thousand feet, in an avalanche of snow and were
never found again. Vose&rsquo;s only consolation in the last
instance was that it occurred when on his way to Sacramento,
while in the former case he saved one of the
precious kegs, which he insisted was the means of saving
him in turn from perishing in the Arctic temperature.</p>
<p>The shadowy trail wound in and out among the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
gorges and ca&ntilde;ons, beside towering mountain walls, at
a dizzying elevation, over ridges above the snow line,
across table lands, through forests of pine and cedar
and tumultuous mountain torrents, where he took his
life in his hands every time he made the venture.</p>
<p>The unerring marksmanship of Vose and his alertness
reduced the danger from the fierce grizzly bears
and ravening mountain wolves to the minimum, but the
red men were an ever present peril. He had served as
the target of many a whizzing arrow and stealthy rifle
shot, but thus far had emerged with only a few insignificant
hurts. He was ready at the stated times to set
out on his journey, and appeared indeed to welcome the
change in the existence which otherwise became tiresome
and monotonous. It mattered not that his friends
often intimated that he was starting on his last venture
of that nature, for he believed that his &ldquo;time&rdquo; had
been set and it mattered naught what he did, since it
could not be changed.</p>
<p>Vose explained that the cause of his last delay was
the old one&ndash;&ndash;Indians. They had pursued and pestered
him so persistently that he was compelled to hunt out a
new trail, longer and more difficult that the old one, and
which came within a hair of landing him into the very
camp of his enemies. However, everything had turned
out well, and he brought with him the most prized
cargo that ever arrived in New Constantinople.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>First of all, were the two casks of freight, which had
suffered so slight leakage, that Landlord Ortigies complimented
the vigilance of the messenger. Then he
brought with him fully a hundred letters and newspapers.
Each citizen received one, and many had several.
In every instance, the grateful recipient paid Vose a
dollar for his mail, so that the reward was generous, including
as it did a liberal honorarium from the proprietor
of the Heavenly Bower.</p>
<p>In addition to the mail and freight, there were a number
of articles to which no special reference is needed.
In one package, however, every one was deeply interested,
and Nellie Dawson more than the others. Unknown
to the father, a goodly sum had been entrusted
to Adams, with which to purchase such articles as it
was believed the child needed. These included material
for numerous new dresses of gorgeous pattern, stockings,
shoes, slippers, ribbons, hats and even gloves,
trinkets and playthings beyond enumeration.</p>
<p>When these were spread out before the little one, she
clapped her hands and danced with delight. She had
never dreamed of or seen such bewildering wealth, and
the miners were repaid a hundred fold, while the grateful
parent thanked them for their thoughtful kindness.</p>
<p>With no other person of her sex in the settlement, it
would naturally be thought that she lacked in many of
the little attentions which only a mother or adult female
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
friend can give, but such was not the case. There was
not a man among them all, who had not been taught in
the hard school of necessity to become his own tailor
and conservator of clothing. Many had natural taste,
and had not wholly forgotten the education and training
received in the homes of civilization, before they
became adventurers and wanderers. A consensus of
views, all moved by the same gentle impulse, resulted in
Nellie Dawson being clothed in a garb which would
hardly have caused criticism in the metropolis of our
country. Not only that, but she was abundantly provided
against all kinds of weather, and with Vose
Adams making his regular trips westward, there was
no possibility of her ever knowing the want of thoughtful
care.</p>
<p>The education of the little one was never neglected.
Enough has been told to show her brightness, and even
had not her teacher been inspired by his affection for
the little one, the task of imparting knowledge to such
an apt pupil must have been a constant pleasure. This
work, as we have shown, fell by common consent to the
parson, Felix Brush, though his choice at first was not
unanimous. Wade Ruggles was so insistent that he
should have a part in the work, that he was allowed a
trial, but it cannot be said the result of several days&rsquo;
effort was satisfactory. A stealthy inspection of the
blackboard by Budge Isham and the parson disclosed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
that Ruggles had constructed the alphabet on a system
of his own. Some of the letters were reversed, several
inverted, while the forms of others prevented any one
from identifying them except the teacher himself.</p>
<p>An examination of the pupil developed the same
startling originality in Ruggles&rsquo;s system of orthography,
which seemed to be a mixture of the phonetic
and the prevailing awkward method. Thus he insisted
that &ldquo;purp&rdquo; was the right way to spell the name of a
young dog, whose correct title was &ldquo;dorg.&rdquo; Ruggles
was finally persuaded to resign, though he displayed
considerable ill feeling and intimated that the movement
was inspired by jealousy of his success.</p>
<p>Budge Isham not only refrained from referring to
the slip which the parson made in his spelling lesson,
but spoke in such high terms of his success with Nellie,
that every one conceded the right teacher had been selected,
and it would be a misfortune for any one to assume
to take the place of the parson.</p>
<p>Not until the final summing up of all accounts, will
the full measure of the influence of the little one be
known. It was gentle, subtle, almost imperceptible.
Wade Ruggles never broke his resolve not to touch
liquor. Inasmuch as an appetite nourished for years,
cannot be wholly extirpated in a day, he had his moments
of intense yearning for stimulants, when the
temptation was powerful, but his will was still more so,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
and the time came when the terrific thirst vanished entirely,
though he knew it was simply &ldquo;asleep&rdquo; and
could be roused into resistless fury by indulgence in a
single glass.</p>
<p>The parson had a severer struggle. After holding
out for days, he yielded, and by his inordinate dissipation
brought back matters to a fair average. Then he
set about manfully to retrieve himself. A second time
he fell, and then, thank heaven! he gained the mastery.
Henceforward he was safe.</p>
<p>Maurice Dawson himself had been an occasional tippler
for years, but he felt the influence of example and
experienced no trouble in giving up the habit. Several
others did the same, while more tried but &ldquo;fell by the
wayside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Landlord Ortigies noticed the diminution in his receipts,
but, strange as it may sound, down in his heart
he was not sorry. Like nine out of ten engaged in his
business he was dissatisfied, and like the same nine out
of ten, he longed for the chance to take up some other
calling which would bring him bread and butter and no
accusing pangs of conscience.</p>
<p>Before the coming of Nellie Dawson, brawls and personal
encounters often occurred. The walls of the
Heavenly Bower contained several pounds of lead.
Blood had been shed, and the history of the settlement
showed that three persons had died with their boots on,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
but those stirring days seemed to have departed forever.</p>
<p>Parson Brush did a good deal of thinking. When
through with his pupil, he was accustomed to take long
walks into the mountains, his hands clasped behind his
back and his head bowed in meditation. It is safe to
conclude that Conscience was getting in its work with
him.</p>
<p>And so the seasons came and went and the years
rolled on. Varick Thomson, an old miner, who had
spent years of fruitless toil in the diggings of Australia,
lay down and died, and the parson officiated at his
funeral. Two other miners grew weary of the poor success
in Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch and went off on a prospecting
tour deeper into the mountains. A year later another
prospecting party came upon two skeletons, near
a small stream of water, which after careful examination,
were pronounced to be those of their former
friends, doubtless victims of the ferocity of the red
men. Three vagrant miners straggled into New Constantinople
one night and were hospitably entertained
at the Heavenly Bower. Their appearance was against
them, and, when they announced their intention of
making their home at Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch, the suggestion
to them to move on was made in such terms that
they acted upon it and were never seen there again.
Thus it came about that New Constantinople, instead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
of increasing in population and making a bid for the
chieftaincy among the new towns in the West, was
actually shrinking in numbers.</p>
<p>And all this time, Nellie Dawson was growing fast.
Her beautiful mind kept pace with the expansion of her
body. Her natural grace and perfection of figure would
have roused admiration anywhere. Her innocence and
goodness were an ever present benison to the rough
miners, who had long since learned to check the hasty
word, to restrain the rising temper and to crush the
wrongful thought in her presence.</p>
<p>After a time, Maurice Dawson took possession of
one of the deserted cabins which he fitted up, or rather
the community fitted up the principal apartment for the
young queen, whose rule was supreme. No one else
was permitted to share the building with them, though
visitors were constant and Nellie herself continually
passed to and fro among her friends.</p>
<p>But those who watched Dawson saw that a change
had come over him. Formerly there was a quiet waggery
in his nature, much like that of Budge Isham,
which led him to enjoy the rough pleasantries of his
companions, though he rarely took part in them, except
as an inciting cause. One of his greatest pleasures had
been to sit in the Heavenly Bower and exchange reminiscences
with his friends, but all that came to an end.
Night after night passed without his face being seen in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
the place. Those who called at the cabin were treated
hospitably, but he was reserved and moody, and often
failed to hear the words addressed to him. It was evident
that there was something on his mind, though he
showed no disposition to make a confidant of any one.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE CLOUD OF WAR</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I KNOW the cause of Dawson&rsquo;s trouble,&rdquo; remarked
Vose Adams, late one night at the Heavenly Bower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Wade Ruggles, while the rest
listened intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my last trip to Sacramento, two months ago, I
brought him a thick letter: that&rsquo;s what is raising the
mischief with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what was in the letter to make him act so
queer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know? do you expect me to open
and read all the letters I bring through the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bein&rsquo; as you couldn&rsquo;t read the big letters the parson
has painted on the side of the rock a foot high,&rdquo;
said Al Bidwell sarcastically, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t much danger
of your doin&rsquo; that, which the same is lucky for them
as gits love letters like myself regular by each mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which the same you won&rsquo;t git any more onless you
sling your remarks a little more keerful,&rdquo; warned the
mail carrier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the same being that you can&rsquo;t read the directions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
writ onto them, I don&rsquo;t see how you&rsquo;re going to
help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The postmaster at Sacramento is very obligin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
was the significant comment of Vose.</p>
<p>Bidwell saw the dangerous ground on which he was
treading, and made it safe by a jesting remark and an
invitation to Adams and the rest to join him at the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We was on the subject of Dawson,&rdquo; remarked
Ruggles from his seat, for all had learned long before
of the uselessness of inviting him to drink; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s
the opinion of Vose, I understand, that it was the letter
that has made the change in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t any doubt about it,&rdquo; said Adams; &ldquo;fur
the attack took him right after; I noticed the difference
in him the next day. He sets by himself these evenings
after the little gal has gone to bed, smoking his pipe,
without any light in his shanty, and thinking hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wade smoked thoughtfully a minute and then remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether it wouldn&rsquo;t be a good idee to
app&rsquo;int a committee to wait on Dawson and ask him
what the blazes is the matter and whether we can&rsquo;t do
nothin&rsquo; to make a man of him agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Ruggles had become accustomed to act as
chairman at the discussions in the Heavenly Bower, he
had developed a strong faith in committees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a piece of the most onspeakable foolishness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
that I&rsquo;ve run aginst since I settled in New Constantinople,&rdquo;
observed the landlord with a contemptuous
sniff; &ldquo;the minute the committee arrove and stated
their bus&rsquo;ness, Dawson would kick &rsquo;em out of his shanty
and clean across the street, and he&rsquo;d be lacking in the
instincts of a man if he didn&rsquo;t do that same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ortigies forgits that I didn&rsquo;t mean to suggest
that <i>he</i> was to be a member of the committee; I meant
they should be <i>gentlemen</i>; consequently that bars him
out and there wouldn&rsquo;t be no trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand your sarcasm, Wade, but your words
would leave you off the committee likewise; but may I
ask what the members would ask him when they
knocked at his door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any gentleman wouldn&rsquo;t be at a loss what to say,
fur he would only hev to remark sorter careless like
that he had observed the man was acting so queer that
we was afeard he was troubled with remorse over some
crime he&rsquo;d committed, and about which he had got notice
that the officers was lookin&rsquo; fur him, but that if
he&rsquo;d trust us and give a description of the officers, so
there wouldn&rsquo;t be any mistake, we&rsquo;d watch fur &rsquo;em up
the trail and pick &rsquo;em off afore they could profane New
Constantinople with their presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a prodigious sentence for Wade, and he
leaned back and smoked his pipe with considerable self-complacency,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
but it impressed none of his hearers as he
expected. Parson Brush shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a very wise way of introducing yourself to
a man by assuming that he is a fugitive from justice.
In the first place, I am sure there is nothing of the kind
in the case of Dawson. He has probably heard some
news from the East that troubles him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I was sayin&rsquo;,&rdquo; broke in Ruggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not of the nature intimated by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be one of a dozen things; I know you are
all wrong in your guesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every eye was fixed upon the parson, for all were
anxious to learn at what he was hinting. His face was
unusually grave, but he stopped speaking, as if he
deemed it indiscreet to say anything more. He noticed
the looks and whetted the curiosity by adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been so disturbed over the change in Dawson
that I called on him last night and had a talk with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you learn?&rdquo; asked Budge Isham,
the moment Brush showed an inclination to stop talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was hard work to draw him out, but finally
he told me he had received a letter from the East, which
made him think he would have to leave us. That isn&rsquo;t
the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>All were breathless, afraid to give utterance to the
dread that until then was vague and indistinct in their
minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks he must take his daughter Nellie with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Take her away from us? That can never
be allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None felt the anguish of the announcement keener
than the man who made it, but he looked calmly into
the angry faces and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget, my friends, that she is his child and he
has the moral and legal right to do what he thinks is
best for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are <i>our</i> rights?&rdquo; demanded Wade Ruggles;
&ldquo;they mustn&rsquo;t be forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any,&ndash;&ndash;not a single one. But I am satisfied
that one cause of Dawson&rsquo;s distress of mind is the
very question you have asked. He can never cease to
be deeply grateful to all of us for what we have done
for him and his child. He doesn&rsquo;t wish to take her
away for it will be as painful to her as to us. But
friends,&rdquo; continued the parson, with a sense of right
that was creditable to him, &ldquo;Dawson&rsquo;s first duty is to
his child. She is now twelve years old, quite a large
girl and is growing fast. She has never seen girl or
woman since she was brought here; she will soon be a
young woman; she requires association with others of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
her own sex; her welfare demands this; her education
and proper training can never be obtained in this mining
settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddycation!&rdquo; exclaimed Vose Adams; &ldquo;what
have you been doing with her all this time? She must
be as far along in her studies and eddycation as me and
Ruggles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to be hoped so,&rdquo; replied the parson with a
smile; &ldquo;I doubt whether she will meet any one of her
age as proficient in book learning as herself, but there
remains music, etiquette, and above all, the social customs
and accomplishments which can be acquired nowhere
except in the abode of civilization. There is
none upon whom this blow will fall more heavily than
myself, but I have no right to interpose when a man
is doing his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An exploding bomb could not have caused more consternation
than the news brought by the parson. Every
one felt the truth of his words and respected him for
their utterance, but it was like asking them to consent
to the blotting of the sun from the heavens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a way out of it,&rdquo; finally remarked Wade Ruggles
with a brightening face; &ldquo;we can compermise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if Dawson feels that he and the gal must
go, let him split the difference atween us; he can go
and leave her; that will satisfy everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It will hardly satisfy him, since the whole question
is that of taking her with him. He must be left free
to do whatever he chooses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson looked into the gloomy faces turned toward
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, you have all heard the news brought by the
last papers. Fort Sumter has been fired on; President
Lincoln has called for volunteers; the Southern
Confederacy has been declared and civil war has begun.
It is the intention of Dawson to offer his services to
the cause of the Union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall enlist too,&rdquo; declared Wade Ruggles,
compressing his lips, &ldquo;but it will be on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; added Budge Isham; &ldquo;I am from
Alabama, and if she secedes, as she is sure to do, I am
ready to lay down my life in her defence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, pards, but that shoves me into the Union
army,&rdquo; remarked Al Bidwell, puffing quietly at his
pipe; &ldquo;we must keep the balance right, but we&rsquo;ll part
friends here and we&rsquo;ll be friends till we shoulder our
muskets. Then we&rsquo;ll do all we can to kill each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further discussion disclosed that the citizens of New
Constantinople were about equally divided in their allegiance,
but all of them were not yet ready to take up
arms in support of the cause with which they sympathized.
There were eight who announced their intention
of making their way to San Francisco, there to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
find the most available route to the points necessary to
reach. It was typical of that stupendous struggle, the
greatest of modern times, that four of these recruits
were ardent supporters of one cause and four equally
eager to risk their lives for the other. They were the
warmest of friends and had been for years, willing to
face any danger for the sake of the remainder. It would
be the same until they parted, and then, as one of them
had already expressed it, they would devote every energy
to trying to kill one another.</p>
<p>None of the volunteers faltered until Maurice Dawson
decided to leave his daughter at the settlement until
his return, if so be he should be permitted to return.
He knew of no better or safer place for her, nor of any
friends to whose care he would more cheerfully commit
her, in case it should be his lot to fall on the field of
battle.</p>
<p>It had been Parson Brush&rsquo;s intention to be Dawson&rsquo;s
comrade in his perils, but when the father begged him
to stay behind to look after his child he consented. And
so the programme, so fraught with momentous consequences,
was arranged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE BLUE AND THE GRAY</h3>
</div>
<p>The four years of stupendous war came to an end.
The sun of the Southern Confederacy went down in
gloom and defeat behind the hills of Appomattox, never
to rise again, and blessed peace brooded over a reunited
nation, which shall endure through the coming
ages to the end of time.</p>
<p>It was only the faint echoes of the mighty struggle
that, faintly reverberating across prairie and mountain,
reached the little mining settlement nestling
among the solitudes of the Sierras. Vose Adams made
more frequent journeys to Sacramento, in order to
gather news of the terrific events, which were making
history at an appalling rate. Upon his return, the miners
gathered round Parson Brush, or some other one
with a good voice, who stood up, with every eye centred
on him and every ear keyed to the highest point
and they listened with breathless interest until the
thrilling story was read through to the end.</p>
<p>The same diversity of sentiment that appeared at
first continued to the last, but the parson&rsquo;s earnest
words and his insistence that no quarrels should take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
place among the neighbors prevented any outbreak,
though more than once the point was perilously near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your sympathies are with the Union or with the
South,&rdquo; he said impressively, &ldquo;there is nothing to prevent
your taking up arms, but it must be on the battle
field and not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this wise counsel prevailed. Now and then some
ardent partisan shouldered his rifle, bade his friends
a hasty good-by and hurried away. One by one, they
went until the new recruits numbered five. Thus the
population of New Constantinople dwindled to about
one-half, and retaining its exclusive tastes, permitted
no new comers to join them, so that the boom which
in its early days was so confidently looked for sank to
zero and vanished. In truth it looked as if New Constantinople
was doomed to die of dry rot.</p>
<p>Strange news came now and then from the men who
had gone to the war. Maurice Dawson wrote often to
his daughter Nellie, whose letters, it can well be understood
were the bright spots in his life of adventure
and danger. She had improved wonderfully under the
careful tuition of Parson Brush, who, gaining experience,
as he saw the brightness of her mind, found his
work of the most pleasant nature conceivable. She displayed
a thirst for knowledge and made advances which
astonished him. The books needed for her instruction
were procured by Vose Adams in Sacramento, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
she valued such presents more than anything else. The
teacher declared many a time, with a certain pride, that
she put him upon his mettle to make clear the abstruse
problems with which he wrestled when in college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How she will surprise the boys and her father when
they come back,&rdquo; reflected the parson; &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t take
her much longer to reach the point beyond which I cannot
lead her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her friends who remained, the growth and improvement
of the girl were astonishing. Probably no
one of her sex ever gave nature itself a better chance
to show what she can do with a healthy frame, when
untrammeled by the fashions and requirements of modern
usages. Her lithe, comely figure was perfect. She
never knew an hour&rsquo;s illness. The cheeks had the rose
tint of health, the eyes were clear, the teeth perfect and
her spirits buoyant. As one of the men expressed it,
she was like a burst of sunshine in the settlement.</p>
<p>But Parson Brush was thoughtful. He saw that
she was crossing the line into young womanhood, and
that her own interests demanded that she should go
out into the world of which he had told her so much;
that she should meet those of her own sex and learn
the mysteries of her own being. The affection of her
friends could not make up for this lack. It cost the
honest fellow many a pang when he thought of this,
but his consolation lay in the inevitable conclusion that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
nothing could be done until the return of her parent
or until his wishes were made known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it so happens that he shall fall in battle, then a
grave problem must be met. It will not do for her to
remain here; I will talk it over with the others and we
shall make some arrangement for her good,&rdquo; and with
this conclusion he was content to await the issue of
events.</p>
<p>Occasionally the parson received a letter from the
father. The missives were models in their way, telling
of his experiences in the service of the battles,
of the prospect of victory and his faith in the final triumph
of the great struggle. He thanked the teacher
for his interest in his child and assured him that his
kindness would never be forgotten by father or
daughter.</p>
<p>Vose Adams continued his frequent journeys to Sacramento,
for those were stirring times and he was as
anxious as his friends for news. Always on his return
he was met by Nellie some distance down the winding
trail, and, as soon as she was in sight, he held up the
plump letter for which she yearned, and over which she
was made happy beyond expression, and he never failed
to carry back with him the reply of the child, who knew
how much it cheered the brave soldier in the distant
East and South fighting the battles of his country.</p>
<p>For two years and more there was not a break in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
this correspondence. Dawson must have been a good
soldier, for, though he enlisted as a private, he was
soon promoted, and before the close of the two years,
was a full fledged captain, with the brevet of major.
It was about this time that one of his letters gave the
story of Gettysburg. In the hell-blast of Pickett&rsquo;s
charge two of his old friends, who had left New Constantinople
to fight for the South, were riddled, and
another, marching at the captain&rsquo;s side, had his head
blown off by an exploding shell. Thus in one engagement
three of the old residents of the mining settlement
were wiped out.</p>
<p>Only once or twice was any news received of Al Bidwell.
It was known that Ruggles was with the Army
of Northern Virginia, but no tidings came of Budge
Isham and Ike Hoe. The continued silence was accepted
as almost certain proof of their death, and yet
both were well and unharmed.</p>
<p>One day in early summer, two sunburned, shaggy
men rode down the mountain side and drew up their
horses in front of the Heavenly Bower. They had
ridden from the East and had come through many
hardships and dangers. One of them wore a partial
uniform of blue, while the other was of a faded, butternut
tinge. The two had been engaged for years in
trying to slay each other, inclusive of their respective
friends, but failing in the effort, gave it up when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
final surrender took place at Appomattox. Both were
from New Constantinople, and they now turned their
faces in that direction. Starting from widely separated
points their lines of travel converged and finally
joined. When they met, there was a moment of mutual
sharp scrutiny, then an exclamation of delight, a fervent
handclasp and a moistening of the eyes, as both exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, old boy! There&rsquo;s no one in the
world I would rather meet than you! Shake again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they did, and henceforward they followed the
same trail and &ldquo;drank from the same canteen.&rdquo; They
shared their rations with each other, and in the regions
of the West, where danger lurked in the air, one
watched while the other slept, ready to interpose his
body as a shield between peril and his comrade.</p>
<p>And what splendid soldiers the Civil War made!
How those veterans could fight! What pluck, what
coolness, what nerve, what daring they displayed!
There was one stormy night beyond the Mississippi,
when a band of jayhawkers, believing the two men carried
a few hundred dollars, formed a plan for shooting
both for the sake of the plunder. There were six of
the outlaws at the opening of proceedings, but at the
close just half the number was left, and one of them
carried away a wound with him, from which he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
never recover, while the defenders did not receive a
scratch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard that rebel yell of yours,&rdquo; remarked
the veteran who wore the blue, &ldquo;it tingled through my
veins as it did at Chancellorsville, Antietam and various
other scenes of unpleasantness. I couldn&rsquo;t help
sailing in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to let out the yawp,&rdquo; returned his
companion, &ldquo;but when the shooting began, it was so
like old times I couldn&rsquo;t help it. It was real enjoyable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the dry response, &ldquo;but rather more so
for us than for the other fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days later a band of Indians concluded to try
their hand upon the veterans, but the trouble was that
the red men could not get a fair chance. Before they
arrived within effective striking distance, the veterans
began shooting, and whenever they shot somebody fell.
The thing became so monotonous that the hostiles gave
it up in disgust and drew off. Thenceforward the old
soldiers had comparatively an easy time of it.</p>
<p>And so, after a ride of more than two thousand miles
on horseback, these two men entered Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch
and drew rein in front of the Heavenly Bower. Their
coming caused a sensation, for their looks showed they
were veterans of the war and were certain to bring important
news. The couple smiled and whispered to each
other, for they saw that no one suspected their identity.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>Among the wondering group that gathered round
was Nellie Dawson. She was profoundly interested,
for Vose Adams had made two journeys to and from
Sacramento without bringing a letter from her father.
Doubtless these men could tell her something, and she
stood on the edge of the group, waiting for them to
speak and for the opportunity to question them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see her?&rdquo; whispered one of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; gracious! hasn&rsquo;t she grown? Why, she was
a little girl when we left and now she&rsquo;s a young
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed if she isn&rsquo;t! She wears such long dresses
that you can see only the tiny toes of her shoes; we&rsquo;ve
obsarved a good many purty women since we left these
parts, but nothing that could come up to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can bet your life! She hasn&rsquo;t any idee of who
we are, nor have the boys, but it looks to me as if the
parson is a little suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the patronage of the Heavenly Bower had
shrunk a good deal, Landlord Ortigies was as genial
and hospitable as ever. The new arrivals had time only
for a few secret comments, when he came forward:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers, you&rsquo;re welcome to the best we have,
which isn&rsquo;t anything to boast of; look as if you had rid
a good many miles and you must be as tired and thirsty
as your animals. If you&rsquo;ll turn &rsquo;em over to Vose Adams,
he&rsquo;ll &rsquo;tend to them, and, if you&rsquo;ll allow me, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
shall have a good meal, which before the same, I beg
to tender you some distilled home brewed Mountain
Dew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking the landlord for his offer, the men dismounted
and waited outside, while he brought forth
two glasses, half-filled with the fiery stuff of the poetical
name. One of the men took his and eagerly swallowed
it. The other held his aloft, where under the bright
sunlight it glowed crimson like blood. With his hand
motionless for a moment, he slowly inverted the glass
and allowed the liquid to run out on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Max, I reckon you haven&rsquo;t forgot when I done
something like that some four years ago,&rdquo; said the man,
turning toward the astonished host.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>WAITING</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wade Ruggles, as I&rsquo;m alive!&rdquo; exclaimed the delighted
landlord, rushing forward and grasping his
hand. Instantly the group closed in, and there was
such laughing and handshaking that for a time nothing
was clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was suspicious,&rdquo; remarked the parson; &ldquo;but,
though you both had beards when you went away, these
have grown so much that they have greatly altered your
appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scanned the other man closely, but before the parson
had identified him, several others had done so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Al Bidwell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the laughing Ruggles; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
fellow, but I&rsquo;m sorry to say that since they made a major-general
of him, he&rsquo;s become a reg&rsquo;lar dude. He
doesn&rsquo;t go out when it rains for fear of soiling his uniform,
and the noise of powder makes him sick, so be
careful how you handle the delicate fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you do not need to be told,&rdquo; was the hearty
response of the parson, &ldquo;that no one could be more
welcome than you; let&rsquo;s shake hands all around again.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>It was some minutes before the flurry was over, for
the delight on both sides was unbounded and the joy
of the reunion great.</p>
<p>One member of the group lingered in the background.
Her face was flushed with delighted expectancy,
but with a coyness unknown in her earlier years,
she hesitated on the outer edge of the circle. She could
not mingle with the rush and waited until the flurry was
over. The men were scarcely less embarrassed than
she, and while not appearing to see her, both were
watching her every movement. When the time came
that the meeting could no longer be delayed, Ruggles
walked to her and extended his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Nellie, aren&rsquo;t you glad to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crinkling of the whiskers at the side of the invisible
mouth showed that he was laughing, and indeed
his white teeth gleamed through his wealth of
beard. Nellie promptly advanced and met him half
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ruggles, I can&rsquo;t tell you how glad I am to
meet you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been asking himself whether it would do to
kiss this vision of loveliness. He wished to do so, but
was afraid. However, the question was settled by the
girl, who, instead of taking the hand, flung her arms
about his neck and saluted him fervently, that is as well
as she could under the conditions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>Al Bidwell came forward and was received in the
same manner. Then, as the two men stepped back and
looked admiringly at her, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see you are the same and yet those beards
make you look different; I love to think of you as you
were when you bade us good-by and rode off four years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be glad to fix up our faces in the old
style,&rdquo; said Ruggles, while his companion nodded assent.
If she had asked them to cut off their heads they
would have unhesitatingly agreed to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt we&rsquo;ve changed somewhat,&rdquo; said Bidwell,
&ldquo;but not one half so much as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I!&rdquo; she repeated in astonishment; &ldquo;why, I am
just the same,&rdquo; and she looked down at her dress, as if
seeking the explanation of his remark; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
changed a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in goodness and all that sort of thing, but we
left a little girl and now I&rsquo;m blessed if we don&rsquo;t find a
young woman, and yet it&rsquo;s the same little girl after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maidenly blush darkened her face and she
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t expect me to stand still all these
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; though we would have been glad if you had
done so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three were standing apart, the others with commendable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
delicacy leaving them to themselves. Nellie
laid her arm on the sleeve of Ruggles, and looking up
yearningly in his face she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give me any news of father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being as him and me was on different sides, I
haven&rsquo;t seen or heard a thing of him since we parted in
San Francisco, but I hope all has gone well with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to Bidwell, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and him was thrown together once or twice
and I met him after Gettysburg, where neither of us
got a scratch, which is more than tens of thousands of
others can say. Then I seen him in front of Petersburg,
where we had the same good luck agin, but in
the fighting round there we lost track of each other.
Are you worried about him, little gal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; she mournfully replied; &ldquo;never once
did Vose Adams come back from Sacramento without
one or two letters from him, but he has now done so
twice, and I haven&rsquo;t heard a word. I fear father is
dead; if he is, my heart is broken and I shall die too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could they say to cheer her, for Vose Adams
made still another journey westward with the same dismal
emptiness of the mail bag, so far as she was concerned.
Every one did his utmost to cheer her, but
none succeeded. The ground taken was that the parent
had set out on his return, but had been hindered by
some cause which would be explained when he finally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
arrived. When not one of the men himself believed the
story, how could he hope to make the mourning daughter
believe it?</p>
<p>Felix Brush took a different stand from the others.
He early settled into the belief that Captain Dawson
was dead, and that it was wrong to encourage hope on
the part of the child when the disappointment must be
more bitter in the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are never to see him again in this world,&rdquo;
he said, at the close of a sultry afternoon, as the two
were seated on a rocky ledge near the cabin in which
she had made her home all alone during her parent&rsquo;s
long absence, &ldquo;what a blessed memory he leaves behind
him! Died on the field of battle, or in camp or
hospital, in the service of his country,&ndash;&ndash;what more glorious
epitaph can patriot desire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is dead then I shall die; I shall pray that I
may do so, so that I shall soon see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, you must show some of the courage
of your parent and prove that you are a soldier&rsquo;s daughter.
Your blow is a severe one, but it has fallen upon
thousands of others, and they have bravely met it. You
are young; you have seen nothing of the great world
around you&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not care to see anything of it,&rdquo; she interrupted
with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will feel different when you have recovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
from the blow. It is an amazing world, my dear. The
cities and towns; the great ocean; the works of art;
the ships and steamboats; the vast structures; the railways;
the multitudes of people; the lands beyond the
seas, with still more marvelous scenes,&ndash;&ndash;all these will
expand like fairy land before you and make you wonder
that you ever should have wished to leave such a realm
of beauty and miracles while in your youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nellie sat for some time in silence, and then rose to
her feet with a weary sigh. Without speaking, she
turned to walk away, but not in the direction of her own
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To look for him,&rdquo; was her sorrowful reply.</p>
<p>It was what he suspected and feared. He knew she
had done the same thing night after night for weeks
past, even when the rains fell and the chilling blasts
made her shiver with discomfort. He could not interpose,
and with the reflection that perhaps it was as well,
he turned mournfully aside and walked slowly toward
the cabins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nellie Dawson passed beyond the limits
of the settlement until all the houses were behind her.
She did not sit down, but folding her arms, after gathering
her shawl about her, bent her gaze upon the trail,
which wound in and out at the bottom of the ca&ntilde;on below,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
for a fourth of a mile, when a mass of projecting
rocks hid it from sight.</p>
<p>Night was closing in. Already the grim walls, thousands
of feet in height, were wrapped in gloom, and
few eyes beside hers could have traced the devious mule
path for more than a hundred yards from where she
stood. The clear sky was studded with stars, but the
moon had not yet climbed from behind the towering
peaks, which would shut out its light until near the
zenith.</p>
<p>The soft murmur of the distant waterfall, the sound
of voices behind her, the faint, hollow roar, which always
is present in a vast solitude, filled the great space
around her and made the stillness grander and more impressive.</p>
<p>All this had been in her ears many a time before, and
little heed did she give to it now. Her musings were
with that loved one, who had been silent for so many
weeks, and for whose coming she longed with an unspeakable
longing. She knew the course of the trail
so well, though she had never been far over it, that she
was aware at what point he must first appear, if he ever
appeared, and upon that point she centered her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something tells me that when father comes it will
be in the night time,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I know he has tried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
hard to reach me, and what could it be that held him
back? I will not believe he is dead until&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her heart gave a quicker throb, for surely that was
a faint sound in the path, though too far off for her to
perceive the cause. She could not tell its precise nature,
but fancied it was the footfall of some animal.
She took several quick steps forward on tiptoe, with
head extended, peering and listening, with all her senses
at the highest tension.</p>
<p>Hark! she heard it again. Surely it was the noise of
hoofs, for it was repeated and the sounds ran into each
other as if the animal were trotting or galloping, or
mayhap there was more than one of them.</p>
<p>Yes; some one was drawing nigh on the back of
horse or mule. There was no mistaking the hoof beats,
and in the gloom the figure of an animal and his rider
assumed vague form, growing more distinct each moment.
Nellie broke into a run, her arms outstretched
and her hair flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! father! I know it is you! It is I&ndash;&ndash;Nellie,
your own Nellie, who has waited so long for you! You
have come at last!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>HOME AGAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>The horseman coming up the trail had assumed
definite form. Checking his animal he sat transfixed
until the flying girl was beside him. Then he bent forward
and in a choking voice, answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Nellie, it is your father! God be thanked for
permitting me to come to you again. And you are Nellie!
But how grown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Dawson leaned over the side of his horse
and, passing his strong arm around the waist of his
daughter, lifted her up in front of him. Then he pressed
his lips to hers, and half-laughing and half-crying
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the happier, you or I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be any happier than I; but, father,&rdquo; she
added in amazement, &ldquo;where is your other arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buried in Southern Virginia as a memento of my
work for the Union, but, my dear child, <i>I</i> am here; isn&rsquo;t
<i>that</i> enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, bless your heart!&rdquo; she exclaimed, nestling up
to him; &ldquo;it all seems like a dream, but it <i>isn&rsquo;t</i>, for I can
feel you. I am so sorry,&rdquo; she added, noticing the sleeve
pinned to his breast; &ldquo;how you must have suffered.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! it isn&rsquo;t anything to lose an arm; it&rsquo;s not
half so bad as having your head blown off or both legs
carried away. After going nearly through the war
without a scratch, I caught it just before Appomattox,
but thousands were less fortunate and I am thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you not write to me and tell me all
this? Mr. Brush was sure you were dead, and I know
the rest thought so, too, though they didn&rsquo;t talk that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did have a close call; I got the fever while in the
hospital and didn&rsquo;t know so much as my own name for
several weeks. Then, when well enough to write, I
concluded to come myself, believing I could keep up
with any letter and you would be gladder to see me than
to receive anything I might send.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While these words were passing the steed remained
motionless, but Nellie had observed from the first that
her parent had a companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;you have some one with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my child, I had forgotten it in my delight at
meeting you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A horseman was sitting as motionless as a statue in
the trail behind them, the form of himself and animal
clearly outlined in the obscurity. He had not spoken
nor stirred since the coming of the girl. The head of
the steed was high, but beyond and above it loomed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
head and shoulders of the man sitting upright, like an
officer of dragoons. The gloom prevented a fair view
of his countenance, but Nellie fancied he was of pleasing
appearance and wore a mustache.</p>
<p>Captain Dawson turned his head and looked over his
shoulder, as if to locate the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Lieutenant Russell; he served under me
during the latter part of the war; he is my friend, Nellie,
for he saved my life. Lieutenant,&rdquo; added the captain,
elevating his voice, &ldquo;this is my daughter Nellie
of whom you heard me speak so often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young officer lifted his cap, the graceful gesture
being plainly seen and replied with a pleasant laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dawson, I am glad to become acquainted with
you and hope I shall soon be favored with a better
view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope to see more of the one that was the
means of saving my dear father,&rdquo; she was quick to
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess that was equal on both sides, for I
should never have reached this place but for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, what is <i>that</i>?&rdquo; abruptly asked Nellie,
shrinking closer to him; &ldquo;have you a bear following
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That which caused the startled question was a huge
animal, which came slowly forward from the gloom in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
which he had been enveloped. The horses showed no
fear of him, and he sniffed at the skirts of the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; replied her father; &ldquo;you may
consider him a lion or tiger or both combined. He is
Lieutenant Russell&rsquo;s dog Timon, one of the biggest,
fiercest, but most intelligent and affectionate of his kind.
We three are comrades, so you must accept him, too, as
your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two now gave rein to their horses and within
briefer time than would be supposed, every man in New
Constantinople knew of the arrival of the couple and
had given them right royal welcome. It was the most
joyous incident in the history of the little mining settlement.
Every one knew of the corroding grief of
Nellie Dawson, and there was not a heart that did not
go out in sympathy to her. All were gathered around
and within the crowded quarters of the Heavenly
Bower, where the two men and Nellie ate their happy
evening meal. Then the pipes were lighted, and with
the girl perched upon her father&rsquo;s knee, the rest listened
to his story, which he summarized, leaving the
particulars for a more convenient occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry my long silence caused misgiving,&rdquo; said
he looking round in the faces of his friends, &ldquo;but it
could not be very well helped. You have noticed that
whereas I left New Constantinople with two arms, I
am now one short. As I told Nellie, that happened in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
the very last days of the war. It was quite a loss, but
you have little idea of how soon a man can become accustomed
to it. The fact is,&rdquo; added the soldier, with
a grim smile, &ldquo;things are moving so well with me that
I wouldn&rsquo;t give much to have the old limb back again.
I have no doubt General Howard feels the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pruned oak is the strongest,&rdquo; observed Parson
Brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided it isn&rsquo;t pruned too much. With my
wound came an attack of fever, which brought me
nearer death than I ever was in battle, but I came out of
it all and here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What route did you take, captain?&rdquo; asked Wade
Ruggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By steamer to the Isthmus, then up the coast to
San Francisco. There the lieutenant and I joined a
party to Sacramento and each bought a good strong
horse. He had brought his dog Timon all the way
from Virginia, where he was given to him by an old
friend who wore the gray. We were hopeful of meeting
Vose Adams in Sacramento, but he had not been
there for weeks. Instead of him, whom should we
come across but Ike Hoe, who was also getting ready
to start for this place. We three set out nearly ten days
ago, but Ike is still in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said with so grave a face that all knew what
it meant.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of the Indians being so troublesome.
For three days and nights it was little else than fighting.
In the darkness we would steal off and hunt for
some new way through the mountains, but it mattered
not where we went, for we were sure to run against
some of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was it that Hoe met his death?&rdquo; asked the
parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on the third night. We hadn&rsquo;t seen a thing
of the Indians since the noon halt and were hopeful they
had given up the hunt for us. We hadn&rsquo;t eaten a mouthful
for twenty-four hours and were hungry enough to
chew our boots. Ike found a place among the rocks,
where a camp fire couldn&rsquo;t be seen for more than a few
rods and started a blaze. The lieutenant had brought
down an antelope, and if we could get a chance to cook
the steak, we were sure of the right kind of a meal.
Well, we broiled enough to give each all he wanted.
Ike leaned back with a pleasant smile on his face and
remarked that it was worth all the risk to get such a
feast, when I caught the flicker of something like the
dart of a small bird between him and me. Before I
could make out what it was, Ike gave a groan, and rolling
over backward, never spoke or stirred. I saw the
feathered end of an arrow sticking up above his breast.
The head had gone clean through him and it must have
split his heart in two.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But was neither you or the lieutenant harmed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the remarkable part of it. The lieutenant
saw the arrow before I did and warned me. We darted
back in the darkness with our guns ready, but saw and
heard nothing more of the Indians. What was remarkable
about it was that only the single arrow should have
been launched at Ike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if there was but the single Injin,&rdquo; suggested
Bidwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the way we interpreted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was the end of your troubles with the Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite, but they bothered us only once more and
then they managed to get us into a corner, where it
would have been the last of me had it not been for the
lieutenant and Timon. I tell you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain stopped short and smiled. He had seen
the protesting expression on the face of the young officer,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep that story till some time when he isn&rsquo;t
present. But there is another fact which I observed.
There are more white men in the mountains than ever
before and the numbers will increase. The close of the
war has released nearly a million soldiers, who must
make a living somehow. Some will come westward.
You have preserved this place as an exclusive residence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
for yourselves, but you won&rsquo;t be able to do it much
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All saw the truth of these words, and knew trouble
would inevitably follow the mingling of uncongenial
spirits, but they concluded it would be time enough to
meet it when it came, without allowing the fear to disturb
the pleasure of the present communion. Lieutenant
Fred Russell could not fail to be an individual of
keen interest to those who had never before seen him.
While the captain was talking, he sat modestly in the
background, smoking his brierwood, listening as intently
as if everything said was new to him. It was
noticed that like several of the rest, he did not drink at
the bar, though he received numerous invitations.
Truth to tell, he had been quite a drinker, but during
that eventful journey through the mountains, when
Captain Dawson was talking of his daughter, as he
loved to do, he named those who had reformed as the
result of Nellie&rsquo;s influence. The young officer made no
comment, but it struck him that if those rough, hardy
men could abstain, it ought not to be difficult for him to
do the same, and he did it.</p>
<p>Few men were more prepossessing than the lieutenant.
He was educated, about twenty-four years of age,
and undeniably handsome. His campaigns of exposure,
hardship and fighting had hardened his frame into the
mould of the trained athlete. The faded uniform which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
he still wore became him well. The ruddy cheeks had
grown swarthy and browned, but when he removed his
cap, the upper part of his forehead showed as white and
fair as that of a woman.</p>
<p>His nose was slightly aquiline, just enough to give
character to his countenance, the hair which was rather
scant, was dark like the mustache and the small tuft on
his chin. He wore fine, high cavalry boots, reaching
above the knees, a sword and like the captain was armed
with revolver and Winchester rifle.</p>
<p>Crouched at his feet was his massive dog Timon, an
object of as much interest as his master; for, curious as
it may seem, he was the only canine ever owned in New
Constantinople. He was of mixed breed, huge, powerful
and swift, seeming to combine the sagacity and intelligence
of the Newfoundland, the courage of the bull
dog, the persistency of the bloodhound and the best
qualities of all of them. Seeming to understand that he
was among friends, he rested his nose between his paws
and lay as if asleep, but those who gazed admiringly at
him, noted that at intervals he opened one of his eyes
as if to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers, I guess it is all right, but I&rsquo;m taking no
chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coming with the credentials that no one else ever
bore, Lieutenant Fred Russell was sure of a warm reception
at New Constantinople. The depletion of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
population had left more than one cabin vacant and the
best of these was turned over to him. In it he found
cooking utensils, rough but serviceable bedding and accommodations
and much better comforts than he was
accustomed to during his campaigning. Having no immediate
relatives, he had followed the discreet course of
Captain Dawson, who deposited nearly all of his accumulated
pay in a savings institution in the East, reserving
only enough to insure their arrival on the Pacific
coast.</p>
<p>Russell, like so many turned from consumers into
producers by the end of hostilities, was obliged to decide
upon the means of earning a livelihood. He had
begun the study of law, at the time he answered the call
for volunteers, and would have had no difficulty in taking
it up again; but, somehow or other, he did not feel
drawn thitherward. He disliked the confinements of
office work and the sedentary profession itself. He
wanted something more stirring, and active, and calling
for out door life. It was when he was in this mood,
that Captain Dawson urged him to accompany him to
the gold diggings in the Sierras.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I can learn,&rdquo; explained the captain, &ldquo;the
mines haven&rsquo;t panned out to any great extent, but there
is no doubt that there are millions of dollars in gold in
the mountains, and if it isn&rsquo;t at New Constantinople, it
is not far off.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I shall accept your invitation,&rdquo; replied the junior
officer, &ldquo;with the understanding that if the prospect is
not satisfactory, I shall feel at liberty to go somewhere
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the constitutional right of every American
citizen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not as far along in years as you, but I am old
enough to feel that no person ought to fritter away the
most valuable years of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus it was that the lieutenant went to New
Constantinople and received the heartiest welcome
from every one there. And yet among these citizens
were two that had lately become partners and sharers
of the same cabin, and who were oppressed with misgiving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said the parson late at night, when he
and Wade Ruggles were smoking in their home, with
no one near enough to overhear them; &ldquo;Captain Dawson
has made the mistake of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In bringing Lieutenant Russell to New Constantinople.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite foller your meaning, parson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you do; you understand it as well as myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a suspicion of it, but are you afraid to trust
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know better than to ask that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead then and give me the partic&rsquo;lars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place then, the lieutenant is young and
good looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortinitly there can&rsquo;t be any doubt of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nellie Dawson has never seen a handsome young
man&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exceptin&rsquo; you and me, and we ain&rsquo;t as young as we
once was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is now a young woman and ready to fall in
love, and just at the right hour, or rather the very worst
hour, the captain brings the man here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have spoke the exact thoughts I had in mind
all along; you&rsquo;re right, parson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would have been better pleased had Ruggles contradicted
him. He did not wish to believe that which
he could not help believing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must treat him well because the captain brings
him and he has saved the captain&rsquo;s life, but, Wade, <i>we
must watch them both close</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you agin, but what shall we do if we
find him making love to the little gal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson&rsquo;s fierce reply showed how deeply his feelings
were stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warn him just once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as bad about it as you do, but, parson, I
haven&rsquo;t forgot that afore the war broke out, and we
was afeard the captain meant to take the gal away to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
have her eddycated, you told us it was none of our bus&rsquo;ness
and he had the right to do as he thought best with
his own child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that was true at the time, but the conditions
have changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i> I can&rsquo;t foller you. &rsquo;Spose the captain is agreeable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>won&rsquo;t</i> be!&rdquo; exclaimed Brush, who in the depth
of his excitement added an exclamation which sounded
perilously like profanity. But for the parson&rsquo;s intense
earnestness, Ruggles would have quizzed him, but he
pitied the man and at the same time was distressed himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re right, but I doubt it. We&rsquo;ve all felt
for a good while that sooner or later, we must lose the
little one. Now that she&rsquo;s growed up, the captain may
feel more than ever that she must be took off to some
town where all the men ain&rsquo;t savages, and she can see
some of her own kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he puts it that way, we shall have to submit. He
can take her where he wills, for my position is the same
as four or five years ago, but nobody else must take her
from among us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruggles&rsquo;s mood was now quite similar to that of his
partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I see anything wrong in the doings of that pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
faced young officer, I&rsquo;ll shoot him down like a mad
dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two were in the ugliest temper conceivable. They
continued to smoke, but their meditations were tumultuous
and revengeful. Each breast contained a
strange disturbing secret that either would have died
before confessing, but nevertheless, it was there and
had taken ineradicable root within the past days and
weeks.</p>
<p>Felix Brush, as the reader knows, had been the instructor
of Nellie Dawson from infancy. He was the
medium through which she had gained an excellent
book education. He had held many long confidential
talks with her. She, in her trusting innocence, had told
him more of her inmost thoughts, her self communings,
her dim, vague aspirations, than she imparted to anyone
else.</p>
<p>And he could not but notice her wonderful budding
beauty. Surely, he thought, such a winsome creature
was never born. He had begun to ask himself in a
whispered, startled way: &ldquo;Why may I not possess this
mountain flower? True, I am much her senior, but I
will nourish, protect and defend her against the world,
as no younger man could or would. She believes in my
goodness, far more than I deserve. I will cultivate the
affection within her of whose nature she has as yet no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
comprehension. By and by, when she is a few years
older, perhaps I may claim her. More extraordinary
things have happened and are happening every day. I
have but to keep her uncontaminated from the world,
of which I have told her so much, so that when she goes
forth, she shall be under my guardianship&ndash;&ndash;the most
sacred guardianship of all for it shall be that of husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he added, his heart throbbing with the new,
strange hope, &ldquo;all this, please heaven, shall come to
pass if things go on as they are, and no younger man
with better looks crosses my path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now that younger and better looking man had
crossed his path.</p>
<p>The knowledge seemed to rouse all the dormant resentment
of his nature, and to undo the good that the
girl herself had done in the years that were gone. He
felt that if he lost her, if his cherished dream was to be
rudely dissipated, he would go to perdition.</p>
<p>And somewhat similar in range and nature were the
communings of Wade Ruggles, who until this eventful
evening, had cherished a hope, so wild, so ecstatic, so
strange and so soul-absorbing that he hardly dared to
admit it to himself. At times, he shrank back, terrified
at his presumption, as does the man who has striven to
seize and hold that which is unattainable and which it
would be sacrilege for him to lay hands upon.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m three months younger than the parson,&rdquo; he
would reflect when the more hopeful mood was upon
him; &ldquo;neither of us is in danger of being hung for our
good looks, but I&rsquo;ve got the bulge on him dead sure. I
had too much in the way of whiskers to suit the little
one, when I came back from the war; she wanted to see
me as I was when I left; <i>why was that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After pausing for a reply, he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So accordin&rsquo; I trimmed &rsquo;em off and she says I&rsquo;m
better looking than ever, and what she says in Dead
Man&rsquo;s Gulch and New Constantinople, goes. She
meant it, too, as I could see by the sparkle of her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went all through the war without swallerin&rsquo; a
mouthful of strong drink, even when the doctor ordered
it. I&rsquo;ve contrived, sort of accerdental and off hand like,
to let her know them circumstances and I&rsquo;ve seen it
pleased her immense. I&rsquo;ve been layin&rsquo; out some of my
money for clothes, too, since I got back. Vose bought
me a coat in Sacramento, blue with brass buttons. I&rsquo;ve
had a necktie that has been laid away till the proper
time comes to put it on. There are three or four yards
of silk in it and it will knock a rainbow out of sight. I
didn&rsquo;t want to overwhelm her too sudden like, and have
been layin&rsquo; back for the right occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s arriv! I must knock that leftenant out, and that
necktie will do it! I&rsquo;m mighty glad the parson hain&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
got any foolish dreams &rsquo;bout the gal. The leftenant is
the only galoot I&rsquo;ve got to look out for, or rather,&rdquo;
added the miner grimly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one he&rsquo;s got to beware
of. I&rsquo;m in dead earnest this time.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>YOUNG LOVE&rsquo;S DREAM</h3>
</div>
<p>That which in the nature of things was inevitable
came to pass. Lieutenant Russell, in the same moment
that his eyes rested upon Nellie Dawson, was smitten,
as hopelessly as ever ardent lover was smitten by the
lady whom he worshiped. The many things which the
father had told him about his daughter naturally excited
interest in her, but the young officer never
dreamed of looking upon such marvelous beauty as that
which met his gaze in that secluded ca&ntilde;on of the
Sierras. It required all his self-control from drawing
attention to himself by his admiration of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a perfect combination of face,
feature and figure,&rdquo; he reflected when alone. &ldquo;It is an
illustration of what nature can do when left to herself.
Then, too, she has a fund of knowledge that is amazing,
when all the circumstances are considered. I
haven&rsquo;t had much chance to converse with her, but I
heard enough to know that she would shine by virtue
of her mind among the most accomplished of her sisters,
who have had every advantage that civilization
can give. She is a flower nourished on a mountain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
crag, exhaling all its fragrance, untainted by a poisonous
breath from the outer world. Who would have
dared to say that amid this rough, uncouth people, such
loveliness could take root and nourish? And yet it is
that loveliness which has permeated and regenerated
the miners themselves. But for her these nights would
be spent in drinking, roistering, fighting and carousing.
It is her blessed influence, which unconsciously to herself
has purified the springs of life. Like the little
leaven she has leavened the whole lump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passing days increased his interest in her, until
very soon he confessed to himself that he was deeply
in love with Nellie Dawson. She had become dearer to
him than his own life. He could not live without the
hope of gaining and possessing her. He would remain
in New Constantinople and starve, even though a Golconda
was discovered a few miles away. He would
linger, hopeful, buoyant and believing that the dream
of his existence was to be crowned with perfect fruition.</p>
<p>But the sagacious lieutenant had learned to be observant
and to note the most trifling things that escape
the eyes of the majority of persons. Thus it was that
the secret which Wade Ruggles and Parson Brush believed
was hidden, each from everyone except himself,
became as clear as noonday to him. He pitied them
and yet he extracted a grim amusement from the fact.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They are hopelessly infatuated with her; they are
excessively jealous and would rather shoot me than
have me win. They are more than double her age, and
yet they can see no incongruity in hoping to win her.
They will hope on until the awakening comes. Then
they will be my deadliest enemies. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if I receive a call and warning from them, but
neither they nor the whole world shall turn me from the
prize which is more than all the gold, mined or unmined,
in the Sierras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one could have been more circumspect than the
young man. He treated Nellie Dawson with the chivalrous
respect of a Crusader of the olden time. He was
always deferential, and, though he managed frequently
to meet and chat with her, yet it invariably had the appearance
of being accidental. Fortunately his feeling
of comradeship for Captain Dawson gave him a legitimate
pretext for spending many evenings in his cabin,
where it was inevitable that he should be thrown into
the society of the daughter.</p>
<p>Wade Ruggles and the parson noted all this with
growing resentment. When it had continued for several
weeks, the two friends had a conference over the
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, parson, it won&rsquo;t do to wait any longer,&rdquo;
observed Ruggles, puffing away at his pipe; &ldquo;things is
getting dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; asked his companion, who held
precisely the same opinion, but disliked to admit it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a particle of doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&ndash;&ndash;we agreed to give him warning didn&rsquo;t
we?&ndash;&ndash;just once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s only fair that you should let a man know
afore you hit him, so he can brace himself for the shock,
as it were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we are going to do it, there is no use of
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use! It&rsquo;ll git worse every day. Let&rsquo;s go over to
his place now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely we&rsquo;ll find him there; he spends nearly
every evening in the cabin of Captain Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither fancied the task, and, had not their feelings
been so wrought up, they never could have been induced
to undertake it, but because of their misgivings,
nothing could have dissuaded them from their purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he comes to think soberly of it,&rdquo; added Ruggles,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll thank us for giving him warning in time.
If we wait much longer, it might be too late; we
couldn&rsquo;t scare him off the track, but now he&rsquo;ll show his
sense by stopping at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two passed out of the house and walked to the
cabin of Lieutenant Russell. Relieved, and yet in a certain
sense dismayed, they found the young officer at
home engaged in reading. The instant he saw and admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
them, he knew the errand on which they had
come. Except for the grave question involved, that
which followed would have been a delicious comedy.
The lieutenant could not have treated a brother with
greater cordiality and never did host shine more brilliantly.
He fell to talking of war times, drew out Ruggles,
interested the parson and gave some of his own
stirring experiences. They remained two hours and
went away charmed, without having once referred to
Nellie Dawson. They voted the young man a good fellow,
concluded they were mistaken about his admiring
the young lady, and thought it lucky they had not made
fools of themselves.</p>
<p>When they were clear of the house, Lieutenant Russell
laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their faces gave them away; they were loaded and
primed, but I drew their charges; to-night they will
vote me one of the best fellows that ever lived; to-morrow
they will begin to doubt, and by and by the sweetest
privilege they can ask will be to shoot me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most curious feature of the tragical incidents
that followed was the obtusiveness of Captain
Dawson. What every one else saw was veiled from
him, until at times he almost seemed wilfully blind. The
two men had gone through many perilous experiences
together, and sometimes alone. It had been the fortune
of the younger officer to serve the elder, more than once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
when in imminent danger and none could be more
grateful than the captain.</p>
<p>As for Nellie Dawson herself, it is unlikely that for a
time she suspected the truth in all its fulness. She
knew that hers was a peculiarly sweet enjoyment, while
her deft fingers were busy with some needlework, to
listen to the reminiscences of the two. Sometimes she
started with a shock of alarm, when the father pictured
in his graphic way a situation from which it seemed no
escape was open to him. Forgetful for the moment of
the fact that he was there before her, alive and well, she
fairly held her breath, until the <i>denouement</i> came. Not
until then were her fears wholly relieved.</p>
<p>And when the parent rendered such glowing tributes
to the bravery of the young officer, recalling events of
so thrilling a nature that the lieutenant never would
have dared to describe them in similar terms, how could
the daughter help the kindling of admiration for the
handsome young man? How could she avoid feeling
grateful, when she knew that he had risked his life for
her parent, even on their late journey through the
mountains? In truth, everything tended to fan the
flame that had already been kindled in both hearts.</p>
<p>It was late one night, after the tired Nellie had withdrawn,
that the visitor made her the subject of the conversation,
the approach being so tactful, that the captain
had no suspicion of its object.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you intend to spend all your life in this out of
the way corner of the world?&rdquo; was the question of the
lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably I shall. Just before I went to war, I became
convinced that my duty to my daughter demanded
I should move to the East, in order to give her the education
she can never receive here. However, when I
went to the war, there was no place except this where I
could leave her. When I come back, I find her a young
woman, with excellent book knowledge, thanks to
Brush and the kind attention of the others. Sometimes
I think that she is so innocent and ignorant of evil, that
it will be better for her to spend the rest of her life
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a serious matter, but neither you nor she should
be content to remain in this place for the rest of your
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Does that which she can learn elsewhere
outweigh that which she will never learn in this secluded
settlement? Is not the man or woman fortunate
who never comes face to face with the ingratitude, the
treachery, the selfishness, the baseness and the sin
which are the accompaniments of civilization? In this
untainted mountain air, her nature will retain its freshness
and purity; her life will be a well spring of happiness
and goodness to all with whom she comes in contact;
I shall never marry, and mean to keep her by me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
until in the order of nature I am called away. That is
the only boon that I ask from heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But may not all this be hers and yours if the flower
is transplanted from the wilderness into a more congenial
soil? Has she not already acquired that rugged
strength which renders her nature secure against evil?
Is she not doubly panoplied in goodness by the training
of her infancy and girlhood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to think so, but, lieutenant, I have
lived a few years longer than you. She <i>might</i> not be
safe there; I <i>know</i> she is here.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE THUNDERBOLT</h3>
</div>
<p>Lieutenant Russell was treading on delicate
ground, where the utmost caution was necessary. He
must not alarm his friend. He smoked a few minutes
in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for me to give counsel to my captain, but is
it not a fact that selfishness grows upon us with advancing
years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it occurred to you that in concluding to pass
the remainder of your days in this mining settlement,
you are thinking more of yourself than of your child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I said that warrants that question?&rdquo;
asked the captain sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No higher motive than to protect a daughter from
harm can inspire a father, but if she should be allowed
to close your eyes, when you come to lie down and die,
it will be hers to live: what <i>then</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall leave her comfortably provided for. My
pay amounted to a goodly sum when the war ended,
and it is placed where no one else can reap the benefit of
it. Then, too, as you know we have struck considerable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
paying dirt of late. The prospects are that New Constantinople,
even if a small town, will soon be a rich
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Russell groaned in spirit. Would the parent
never understand him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you expect her to remain here, sharing in all
the vicissitudes of the place? It cannot always stand
still; it will either increase, bringing with it many bad
elements, or it will cease to exist and these people will
have to go elsewhere: what then of the child whom
you have left behind you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, by that time,&rdquo; airily replied the father; &ldquo;she
will be married to some good honest fellow, like the
parson, who seems to be fond of her, as I know she is
of him, but I will not allow her to think of marriage for
a long while to come,&rdquo; he added with emphasis.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Russell had heard all he wished. He had
learned that the father would not consent to the marriage
of his daughter for a number of years, and when
that time came, he would select one of the shaggy, uncouth
miners for her life partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has never thought of <i>me</i> in that capacity, but he
will have to entertain the thought before he is much
older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her dreamings of the mysterious world, with its
teeming multitudes and all manner of men, Nellie Dawson
was sure that none lived who could compare with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
this young cavalier who had come out from that wonderful
realm into the loneliness of her mountain home,
bringing with him a sunshine, a glow, a radiance, a
happiness, and a thrilling life which she had never believed
could be hers.</p>
<p>She often sat with her eyes upon his countenance,
when, in his chair opposite her father, he recalled those
marvelous experiences of his. To her no man could
ever possess so musical a voice, and none so perfect
features and winning ways. It was young love&rsquo;s dream
and in her heart the sacred flame was kindled and
fanned until her whole being was suffused and glowed
with the new life.</p>
<p>One of Lieutenant Russell&rsquo;s firsts acts of kindness to
Nellie Dawson was to present her with his massive
dog Timon. She had shown great admiration from the
first for the magnificent brute, who became fond of her.
The maiden was delighted beyond measure and thanked
the donor so effusively that he was embarrassed. It is
not probable, however, that Timon himself was ever
aware of the change of ownership, for it brought no
change of conditions to him. He had learned to divide
his time about equally between the home of the
lieutenant and that of Captain Dawson, while, like the
young lady herself, he wandered about the settlement
at will. He was a dignified canine, who stalked solemnly
through New Constantinople, or took a turn in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch, resenting all familiarity from every
one, except from the only two persons that had ever
owned him.</p>
<p>The lieutenant reflected much upon his conversation
with Captain Dawson, the impression which he had received
being anything but pleasant. &ldquo;He considers
himself unselfish, and yet like all such he is selfishness
itself. He has determined to spend the rest of his days
in this hole and to keep her with him. He won&rsquo;t allow
her to marry for years, because it might interfere with
his own pleasure; then he intends to turn her over to
that lank, shaggy-faced Brush, who pretends to be a
parson. The captain never thinks of <i>me</i> as having any
claims upon her love. To carry out his plan would be a
crime. If she objects to Brush, he will probably give
her a choice from the whole precious lot, including
Ruggles, Adams, Bidwell, or Red Mike, the reformed
gambler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never once has he asked himself whether his
daughter may not have a preference in the matter, but,
with the help of heaven, he shall not carry out this outrage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the solitude of his own thoughts, the lover put the
question to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am <i>I</i> unselfish in my intentions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Selfishness is the essence of love. We resolve to obtain
the one upon whom our affections are set, regardless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
of the consequences or of the future. It is <i>our</i> happiness
which is placed in the balance and outweighs
everything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued the young officer in his self-communing,
&ldquo;I shall be the luckiest fellow in the world
when I win her and she will be a happy woman. Therefore,
it is her good which I seek as much as my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How characteristic of the lover!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not abduct her. If she tells me she does not
love me; if she refuses to forsake all for me, then I
will bid her good-by and go off and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How characteristic again of the lover!</p>
<p>And yet it may be repeated that Lieutenant Russell
was the most guarded and circumspect of men. He no
longer argued with Captain Dawson, for it was useless.
He rather lulled his suspicion by falling in with his
views, and talked of the future of parent and daughter,
as if it were one of the least interesting subjects that
could come between them.</p>
<p>On one of Vose Adams&rsquo;s pilgrimages to Sacramento,
he returned with a superb mettled pony, the gift of
Lieutenant Russell. With this pet she soon became a
daring and accomplished horsewoman. She was an expert,
too, with the small Winchester and revolver which
her father brought with him from the East. Perched
like a bird upon her own Cap, as she named him, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
often dashed for a mile down the trail, wheeling like a
flash and returning at full speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care,&rdquo; said Parson Brush, more than once;
&ldquo;you ride like a centaur and none knows better how to
use firearms, but there are Indians in these mountains
and they sometimes approach nigh enough to be seen
from New Constantinople. Then, too, your father
brought word that other miners are working their way
toward us. More than likely there are bad men among
them whom it is best you should not meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But none would harm <i>me</i>,&rdquo; was the wondering reply
of the miss; &ldquo;are not all of my own race my
friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be, but alas! it is too much to expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not believe, however, that any danger of
that nature threatened her, but she deferred to the fears
of her father, Lieutenant Russell and the parson to that
extent that she generally had a companion with her on
these dashes down the trail. Sometimes it was Brush,
sometimes Ruggles or her parent, and less frequently
the young officer. Timon always galloped or trotted behind
her pony, and she could not be made to believe that
his protection was not all-sufficient.</p>
<p>The winds of early autumn were moaning through
the gorges and ca&ntilde;ons of the Sierras, bringing with
them the breath of coming winter, which was often felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
with all its Arctic rigor in these depressions among the
towering peaks and ridges. The usual group was gathered
in the Heavenly Bower, though two of the most
prominent citizens were absent. They were Felix Brush
and Wade Ruggles, who were seated in their cabin,
where a small fire had been kindled on the primitive
hearth and afforded the only light in the small apartment.
They had eaten their evening meal and as usual
were smoking.</p>
<p>As neither cared to taste the Mountain Dew, so winsome
to a majority of the miners, the two often spent
their evenings thus, especially since the shadow caused
by the coming of Lieutenant Russell had fallen across
their threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things begin to look better than afore,&rdquo; remarked
Ruggles, sitting with one leg flung across the other
and looking thoughtfully into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I always insisted that the soil about here is
auriferous and we had only to stick to it to obtain our
reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruggles took his pipe from his mouth and looked at
his partner with a disgusted expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout, parson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you refer to the diggings?&rdquo; he innocently
asked in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, that won&rsquo;t do; you know my references
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
to allusions was the leftenant and the young lady. I
say things look better as regards the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the only way there could be. They don&rsquo;t care
partic&rsquo;lar for each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt they did some time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but I mean <i>now</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you explain the change, Wade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chap ain&rsquo;t a fool; he&rsquo;s took notice of our
warnin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aware that we had given him any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not &rsquo;zactly in words, but every time I&rsquo;ve met him
with the gal, I give the leftenant a scowl. Once I come
purty near shakin&rsquo; my fist at him; he&rsquo;s obsarved it all
and is wise in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there is ground for what you say,&rdquo; remarked
the parson, anxious to be convinced of the
hoped-for fact; &ldquo;what I base my belief on is that the
leftenant doesn&rsquo;t accompany her on her little riding
trips as often as her father or you or I: <i>that</i> is a sure
barometer, according to my judgment. Still I have
sometimes feared from the way she talks and acts that
she thinks more of him than is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind! She treats him as she does
everybody else; the leftenant is the friend of the cap
and the leftenant give her the dog that is the size of a
meetin&rsquo; house and the pony hardly as big as the dog, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
she doesn&rsquo;t think half as much of him as of you and me;
how can she?&rdquo; demanded Ruggles, sitting bolt upright
and spreading his hand like a lawyer who has uttered
an unanswerable argument; &ldquo;hain&rsquo;t she knowed us a
blamed sight longer than him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are correct; I didn&rsquo;t think of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How eagerly we accept the argument, flimsy as it
may be, which accords with our wishes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I feel sorter ugly over my &rsquo;spicions,&rdquo; continued
Ruggles; &ldquo;I jest reflect that we&rsquo;ve knowed the
gal ever since she was a baby and her father tumbled
down a hundred feet onto the roof of the Heavenly
Bower, with her in his arms in the middle of that
howlin&rsquo; blizzard,&ndash;&ndash;when I think of that I say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door of the cabin was hastily shoved inward and
Captain Dawson, his face as white as death, strode in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anything of Nellie?&rdquo; he asked in a
husky whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the startled miners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has gone! she has left me!&rdquo; gasped the father
dropping into the only remaining chair, the picture of
despair and unutterable woe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think that?&rdquo; asked the parson, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Russell has gone too! They have fled
together!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>COMRADES IN SORROW</h3>
</div>
<p>Wade Ruggles and Parson Brush sprang to their
feet and confronted the white-faced Captain Dawson,
who stared at them and breathed fast. For a full minute
they gazed into one another&rsquo;s faces, dazed, motionless
and speechless. The partners stood, each with pipe
in hand, the faint smoke curling upward from the
bowls, their slouched hats still on their frowsy heads,
the revolvers at their cartridge belts spanning their
waists, their trousers tucked in the tops of their boots,
and with their heavy flannel shirts serving for coats
and vests.</p>
<p>Captain Dawson was similarly attired. He had
dashed out of his own cabin and into that of his friends,
his long locks flying, and even the strands of his heavy
beard rigidly apart, as if from the consternation that
had taken possession of his very soul.</p>
<p>In those seconds of tomb-like stillness, an ember on
the earthen hearth fell apart and a twist of flame threw
a yellow illumination through the small room, grim and
bare of everything suggesting luxury.</p>
<p>It was the parson who first found voice, but when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
spoke the tones, even to himself, sounded like those of
another person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, it is possible that there is some mistake
about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would to God there might be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistake!&rdquo; he repeated in a husky, rasping voice;
&ldquo;can there be any mistake about <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw out his single arm as he spoke, as if he
would drive his fist through their chests. But he held
a crumpled bit of paper in the face of the parson, who
silently took it from him, crinkled it apart and turning
his side so that the firelight fell on the sheet, began reading
the few words written in pencil and in the pretty
delicate hand which he knew so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it out loud, parson,&rdquo; said Ruggles, speaking
for the first time.</p>
<p>Felix Brush did so in a voice of surprising evenness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>My Dearest Father</span>:&ndash;&ndash;I have decided to go with
Lieutenant Russell. We love each other and I have
promised to become his wife. Do not think I love you
any less for that can never be. I cannot remain here.
You will hear from us soon and then I pray that you
will come to your own</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Nellie</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been to his shanty?&rdquo; asked Ruggles,
who hardly comprehended the meaning of his own
words.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why would he go there?&rdquo; angrily demanded the
parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe the villain changed his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, if he had, <i>she</i> would not be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I went to his cabin,&rdquo; bitterly answered Captain
Dawson; &ldquo;he has not been in the place for hours;
all is dark and deserted; if I found him, I would have
killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three were laboring under fearful emotion, but
with surprising power forced themselves to seem comparatively
calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, tell us about it,&rdquo; said the parson, carefully
folding the bit of paper upon itself and shoving
it into his pocket, unobserved by the others.</p>
<p>Despite his apparent calmness it took a few moments
for the father to gain sufficient self-control to speak
clearly. Seated in the chair, he looked into the embers
of the fire on the hearth, compressed his lips and
breathed hard. His two friends had also seated themselves,
for it seemed to them it was easier to master
their agitation thus than while upon their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I to tell, but my everlasting woe and
shame? The lieutenant and I have been working for
several days by ourselves on a new lead. I had noticed
nothing unusual in his manner nor indeed in that of
my child. At lunch time to-day he complained to me of
not feeling like work, and told me not to expect him back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
this afternoon. I would have returned with him, had
not the indications of the new lead been so good. And
actually he invited me to do no more work until to-morrow,
though why he should have done it, when it
would have spoiled their whole scheme, is more than I
can explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was part of his plan to deceive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it could do that, for there was no
need of his inviting me,&ndash;&ndash;but let it go. It came about
that I worked later than usual, so that it was dark when
I got home. I was surprised to see no light and to find
no fire or Nellie. I thought nothing of that, however,
for who would have believed it possible that there could
be anything wrong? I supposed she was with some of
the folks and being tired I sat down in my chair and fell
asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I awoke, the room was cold, silent and as
dark as a wolf&rsquo;s mouth. I felt impatient and decided
to give her a scolding for being so neglectful. I groped
around until I found a match, intending to start a fire.
I had just lit the lamp and set it down on the table,
when I caught sight of a folded piece of paper with my
name in her handwriting on the outside. It gave me
a queer feeling and my hands trembled when I unfolded
and read it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t clearly remember the next few minutes.
The room seemed to be spinning around, and I think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
I had to sit down to keep from falling, but what saved
me from collapse was my anger. I have been consumed
with indignation once or twice in my life, but was never
so furious, so uncontrollable, so utterly savage as I was
after reading that note. If I could have found Russell,
I would have throttled him. It may sound strange, but
I hardly once thought of Nellie; it was <i>he</i>, the villain,
whom I yearned to get my hands on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Ruggles, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way you
oughter feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what possessed me to do so, but I
rushed out and made straight for his cabin, as if I
would find him there. Of course that too was empty,
and then I came here. Fool that I have been!&rdquo; exclaimed
the parent, leaping to his feet and striding up
and down the room; &ldquo;not to see all this, but,&rdquo; he added
pathetically, &ldquo;I believed that Nellie loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flaming wrath of the two melted into pity for the
stricken father. Parson Brush laid his hand on his
shoulder and compelled him to resume his seat. Then
he spoke with the tenderness of a woman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That child <i>does</i> love you more than she loves her
own life, but she is blinded by her infatuation for that
smooth-tongued scoundrel. It is the nature of her sex
to feel and act thus; but, as I said, it does not mean
that her love for you is less&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of her love for me,&rdquo; fiercely interrupted
the parent; &ldquo;we only judge of a person by his actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you and I have made mistakes&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like this; why did she not ask me? why
did <i>he</i> not tell me that he wished to marry her?&ndash;&ndash;that
is if he does,&rdquo; added the father, as if determined to
make his own cup as bitter as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not ask you, because he knew you would refuse;
for from the first time he entered this community,
he was determined to have her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Ruggles and I read him; we did what no
one else did,&ndash;&ndash;we measured the man. Am I right,
Wade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miner nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every word is as true as gospel; we noticed his
sly looks at her, that first night you and him entered the
Heavenly Bower and she was there. We couldn&rsquo;t make
any mistake about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t warn me! You two are as bad as
he, because you kept the secret when you ought to have
put me on my guard, so that I might have strangled him
at the first advance he made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sympathy for the man prevented his listeners taking
offence at the words which, from any one else,
would have brought serious consequences. The parson
said soothingly:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If you were not so wrought up, captain, you
would not be so unreasonable; suppose Wade and I had
gone to you with the statement that the man who, according
to your own words, had saved your life but
a short time before in the mountains, was a villain, who
contemplated robbing you of your child; what would
you have done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanked you and been on my guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have done nothing of the kind; you
would have cursed us and told us to mind our own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what I would have done, it was your
duty to tell me, regardless of the consequences to yourselves.
I might have resented it, but my eyes would
have been opened and this blow saved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could have opened your eyes, for you were
blind,&rdquo; said the parson, who felt that though the man
was intensely agitated, he ought to hear some plain
truths; &ldquo;even had you suspected there was ground for
our fears, you would have gone to Lieutenant Russell
and demanded an explanation. He would have denied
it, and you would have believed him with the result
that he would have been put on his guard and
would have deceived you the more completely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likewise, as aforesaid,&rdquo; added Ruggles, &ldquo;the villain
would have come to us and made us give our
grounds for our charges. What ridic&rsquo;lous fools we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
would have been, when all we could answer was that
we thought he looked as if he meant to run away with
your darter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be some justice in what you say,&rdquo; replied
the captain more composedly; &ldquo;It was I who was
blind, but I can&rsquo;t understand it. Never until I read that
piece of paper, did I suspect the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howsumever, the parson and me haven&rsquo;t been idle;
we often talked it over and fixed on a line that we
thought would work better than going to you. We
showed the leftenant that we was onto his game; I give
him a scowl now and then, as it fell convenient, that
said &lsquo;Beware!&rsquo; We, that is the parson and me, made
up our minds to watch close, and, at the first sign that
was dead sure, we&rsquo;d fall onto him like a couple of mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fooled us as he did you. We was talkin&rsquo; over
matters the very minute you busted into the door and
was satisfied that he had larned he was playin&rsquo; with fire
and had concluded to drop it. We was as big fools as
you.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>NOW</h3>
</div>
<p>It was the parson who now broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we sit here, lamenting that which cannot
be helped? Do you mean to give up, captain, and let
her go? Will you settle down to toil in the diggings,
giving her no further thought, while this pretty-faced
lieutenant is chuckling over the clever manner by which
he fooled you as well as us&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; fairly shouted the roused parent; &ldquo;I will
follow them to the ends of the earth! They shall not
find a foot of ground that will protect them! She has
never seen me angry, but she shall now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are with you,&rdquo; coolly responded Brush, &ldquo;but
only on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That this account is to be settled with <i>him</i> alone;
you musn&rsquo;t speak so much as a cross word to Nellie;
she will shed many a bitter tear of sorrow; she will
drain the cup to its dregs; <i>he</i>, the cause of it all, is to
be brought to judgment. When do you wish to take
up the pursuit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And we are with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something wonderful in the way Parson
Brush kept control of himself. Externally he was as
calm as when standing in front of the adamantine
blackboard, giving instruction to Nellie Dawson, while
down deep in his heart, raged a tempest such as rouses
into life the darkest passions that can nerve a man to
wrong doing. Believing it necessary to stir the father
to action, he had done it by well chosen words, that
could not have been more effective.</p>
<p>For weeks and months the shadow had brooded over
him. Sometimes it seemed to lift and dissolve into unsubstantiality,
only to come back more baleful than
before. And the moment when he had about persuaded
himself that it was but a figment of the imagination, it
had sprung into being and crushed him. But he was
now stern, remorseless, resolute, implacable.</p>
<p>It was much the same with Wade Ruggles. He
strove desperately to gain the remarkable control of
his feelings, displayed by his comrade, and partly succeeded.
But there was a restless fidgeting which caused
him to move aimlessly about the room and showed itself
now and then in a slight tremulousness of the voice
and hands, but his eyes wore that steely glitter, which
those at his side had noticed when the rumble and
grumble told that the battle was on.</p>
<p>Captain Dawson went from one extreme to the other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
Crazed, tumultuous in his fury, and at first like a baffled
tiger, he moderated his voice and manner until his
companions wondered at his self-poise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have started for Sacramento and are now
well advanced over the trail,&rdquo; he remarked without any
evidence of excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you imagine they set out?&rdquo; asked Brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably about the middle of the afternoon; possibly
earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Ruggles, &ldquo;they have a good six hours&rsquo;
start. They haven&rsquo;t lost any time and must be fifteen
or twenty miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trail is easy traveling for twice that distance,
as I recollect it,&rdquo; observed the captain; &ldquo;after that it
grows rougher and they will not be able to go so fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must have been arranged several days ago,
though it is only guesswork on our part. Of course she
has taken considerable clothing with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not look into her room,&rdquo; said the captain;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use; it is enough to know they made their
preparations and started, accompanied by that dog Timon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No time was wasted. They knew they would encounter
cold weather, for the autumn had fairly set in,
and some portions of the trail carried them to an elevation
where it was chilly in midsummer. Each took
a thick blanket. The captain donned his military coat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
with the empty sleeve pinned to the breast, caught up
his saddle and trappings, his Winchester and revolver,
and buckled the cartridge belt around his waist. Then
he was ready. Neither of the others took coat or vest.
The blanket flung around the shoulders was all that was
likely to be needed, in addition to the heavy flannel shirt
worn summer and winter.</p>
<p>Thus equipped, the three stood outside the cabin,
with the moon high in the sky, a gentle wind sweeping
up the ca&ntilde;on and loose masses of clouds drifting in
front of the orb of night. Here and there a light twinkled
from a shanty and the hum of voices sounded
faintly in their ears. Further off, at the extreme end
of the settlement, stood the Heavenly Bower, with the
yellow rays streaming from its two windows. They
could picture the group gathered there, as it had gathered
night after night during the past years, full of jest
and story, and with never a thought of the tragedy that
had already begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we tell them?&rdquo; asked Ruggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Brush; &ldquo;some of them might wish
to go with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it might be well to take them,&rdquo; suggested Captain
Dawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are enough,&rdquo; was the grim response of the
parson.</p>
<p>Like so many phantoms, the men moved toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
further end of the settlement. Opposite the last shanty
a man assumed form in the gloom. He had just
emerged from his dwelling and stopped abruptly at
sight of the trio of shadows gliding past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, pards?&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; was the curt answer of the captain, who
was leading and did not change his pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be so huffy about it,&rdquo; growled the
other, standing still and puffing his pipe until they vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Vose Adams,&rdquo; remarked the captain over
his shoulder; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll tell the rest what he saw and it will
be known to everybody in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little party was carefully descending the side of
the ca&ntilde;on, with now and then a partial stumble, until
they reached the bottom of the broad valley where the
grass grew luxuriantly nearly the whole year. It was
nutritious and succulent and afforded the best of pasturage
for the few horses and mules belonging to the
miners.</p>
<p>Captain Dawson and Lieutenant Russell had ridden
up the trail, each mounted on a fine steed, which had
brought them from Sacramento. When the saddles
and bridles were removed, the animals were turned
loose in the rich pasturage, which extended for miles
over the bottom of the ca&ntilde;on. There, too, grazed the
pony of Nellie Dawson, the horses of Ruggles and Bidwell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
and the three mules owned by Landlord Ortigies
and Vose Adams. The latter were left to themselves,
except when needed for the periodical journeys to Sacramento.
The little drove constituted all the possessions
of New Constantinople in that line. Consequently, if
any more of the miners wished to join in the pursuit,
they would have to do so on foot or on mule back,&ndash;&ndash;a
fact which was likely to deter most of them.</p>
<p>In the early days of the settlement, before the descent
of that terrible blizzard, fully a dozen mules and horses
were grazing in the gorge, subject to the call of their
owners, who, however, did not expect to need them,
unless they decided to remove to some other site. But
one morning every hoof had vanished and was never
seen again. The prints of moccasins, here and there in
the soft earth, left no doubt of the cause of their disappearance.
Perhaps this event had something to do
with the permanence of New Constantinople, since the
means of a comfortable departure with goods, chattels,
tools and mining implements went off with the
animals.</p>
<p>After that the miners made no further investments in
quadrupeds, except to the extent of three or four mules,
needed by Vose Adams, though he was forced to make
one journey to Sacramento on foot. Thus matters
stood until the addition of the horses. There was always
danger of their being stolen, but as the weeks and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
months passed, without the occurrence of anything of
that nature, the matter was forgotten.</p>
<p>The three men were so familiar with the surroundings
that they made their way to the bottom of the
ca&ntilde;on with as much readiness as if the sun were shining.
Pausing beside the narrow, winding stream,
which at that season was no more than a brook, they
stood for several minutes peering here and there in
the gloom, for the animals indispensable for a successful
pursuit of the eloping ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no saying how long it will take to find
them,&rdquo; remarked the captain impatiently; &ldquo;it may be
they have been grazing a mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any signal which your animal understands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it is doubtful if he will obey it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Dawson placed his fingers between his lips
and emitted a peculiar tremulous whistle, repeating it
three times with much distinctness. Then all stood silent
and listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be asleep. Once he was prompt to obey
me, but he has been turned loose so long that there is
little likelihood of his heeding it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it again and a little stronger,&rdquo; suggested
Ruggles.</p>
<p>The captain repeated the call until it seemed certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
the animal must hear it, but all the same, the result was
nothing.</p>
<p>It was exasperating for the hounds thus to be held in
leash when the game was speeding from them, with the
scent warm, but there was no help for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are wasting time,&rdquo; said Dawson; &ldquo;while you
two go up the gorge, I will take the other direction;
look sharp for the animals that are probably lying
down; they are cunning and will not relish being disturbed;
if you find them whistle, and I&rsquo;ll do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They separated, the captain following one course and
his friends the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a bad go,&rdquo; remarked Ruggles, &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t
find the horses, for we won&rsquo;t have any show against
them on their animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little indeed and yet it will not hold us back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; replied Ruggles with a concentration
of passion that made the words seem to hiss between
his teeth.</p>
<p>Since the stream was so insignificant, Wade Ruggles
leaped across and went up the ca&ntilde;on on the other side,
his course being parallel with his friend&rsquo;s. A hundred
yards further and he made a discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helloa, Brush, here they are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson bounded over the brook and hurried to
his side, but a disappointment followed. The three
mules having cropped their fill had lain down for the
night but the horses were not in sight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE PURSUERS</h3>
</div>
<p>The parson expressed his disappointment in vigorous
language, when, instead of the horses, the hybrids
proved to be the only animals near them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid this proves one thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had a dread all along that the Indians would
run off the horses, but it seems to me that if they had
done so, they would have taken the mules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It strikes me as more likely that the leftenant took
the horses, so as to prevent our follering him and the
gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds reasonable,&rdquo; said the parson thoughtfully;
&ldquo;the plan is so simple that it must have occurred
to him. The mules are too slow to be of any use to
us, and it may be as well that we shall have to go
afoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you figure that out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will conclude that, if we haven&rsquo;t any horses,
we won&rsquo;t follow them; they will, therefore, take their
time and travel so slow, that we&rsquo;ll have the chance to
swoop down on them when they are not expecting it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose there&rsquo;s what you call philosophy in that,
but it doesn&rsquo;t hit me very favorable. We&rsquo;ll see what
the cap thinks&ndash;&ndash;helloa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly and distinctly through the still air came the
signal by which Captain Dawson was to announce his
discovery of the animals. The call scattered all
thoughts of making the journey on foot, and, wheeling
about, the two started off at a rapid pace to join their
friend. At the same moment the call sounded again,
and they answered it to let it be known they understood
the situation. In a brief time they came upon Captain
Dawson impatiently awaiting them. There was no
need for him to tell them he had been successful in his
search, for he was standing beside the three horses,
which were quickly saddled and bridled. A minute
later the men vaulted upon their backs and the captain
said crisply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each seemed to be inspired by the spirit of adventure.
They sat erect in the saddles, drew in a deep inhalation
of the keen night air, and moved off with their
horses on a brisk walk, which almost immediately became
a canter. For a mile, the trail through Dead
Man&rsquo;s Gulch was nearly as hard and even as a country
highway. The width of the ca&ntilde;on varied from a few
rods to a quarter of a mile, with the mountain ridges
on either hand towering far up into cloudland, the tallest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
peaks crowned with snow which the sun never dissolved.</p>
<p>The tiny stream wound like a silvery serpent through
the stretch of green, succulent grass, narrowing gorge
and obtruding rock and boulder. Now and then the
path led across the water, which was so shallow that
it only plashed about the fetlocks of the horses. Captain
Dawson, in his impetuosity, kept a few paces in
front of the other two, as if he were the leader. When
the space increased too much he reined up his animal
and waited until his friends joined him. They were
grim, resolute and for most of the time had little to say
to one another, though, as may be supposed, their
thoughts were of anything but a pleasant nature.</p>
<p>So long as the moon held her place near the
zenith, the ca&ntilde;on was suffused and flooded with
its soft radiance, but the rifts of clouds drifting
before its face rendered the light at times treacherous
and uncertain. The horses had rested so
long, and had had such extensive browsing on
the rich pasturage, that they were in fine condition,
and the gallop seemed more grateful to them than an
ordinary walking gait. The air was cool and the fine
trail, at this portion of the journey, made all the conditions
favorable. After a time however, the ascent and
descent would appear, the ground would become rough
and the best the animals could do would be to walk.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>When Parson Brush remarked that Lieutenant Russell
had proved himself an idiot when he left these
horses behind for his pursuers to use, the captain and
Ruggles agreed with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said Brush; &ldquo;he must have
expected we would be hot after him, within the very
hour we learned of what he had done, or can it be that
he and she concluded we would say, &lsquo;Depart in peace?&rsquo;
If so, the young man shall have a terrible awakening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Ruggles, &ldquo;that it is more
likely he believed that with the start he would gain, it
didn&rsquo;t matter whether we follered or not, feelin&rsquo; sure
that he could keep out of reach and get to Sacramento
so fur ahead of us, that he needn&rsquo;t give us a
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not very familiar with the trail,&rdquo; remarked
the captain, &ldquo;for, as you know, I have passed over it
only twice; first, nearly five years ago, when I went to
the war, and a few months since when I came back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you and Russell did not lose your way,&rdquo; said
the parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was because we did our traveling by day. We
tried it once at night, but came within a hair of tumbling
over a precipice a thousand feet deep. This will
be easy enough, so long as we have the sun to help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably know as much about the trail as
Wade and I, for neither of us has been over it often.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
Consequently, when we travel by night, we shall have
to go it blind, or rather shall do so after awhile, since
all is plain sailing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure of that,&rdquo; observed Ruggles doubtfully;
&ldquo;we must have come a mile already and ought to
have made a turn by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Dawson checked his horse and peered ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be we are off the track? We have come
nearer two miles than one&ndash;&ndash;ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the moon emerged from the obscuring
clouds and their field of vision so broadened that they
saw themselves face to face with an impassable barrier.
The ca&ntilde;on closed directly in front of them like
an immense gate of stone. It was impossible to advance
a hundred feet further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blessed if this isn&rsquo;t a pretty situation!&rdquo;
exclaimed the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have passed the opening, but we haven&rsquo;t far
to return, and you know that a bad beginning brings a
good ending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I would rather chance it on a good beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruggles was the first to wheel and strike his horse
into a gallop, which he did with the remark that he
knew where the right passage was located. His companions
were almost beside him. The ca&ntilde;on was of
that peculiar conformation that, while it terminated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
directly in front, it contained an abrupt angle between
where the party had halted and the mining settlement.
At that point it was so wide that the little stream, which
might have served for a guide, was lost sight of. Had
they followed the brook, they would not have gone
astray. The only inconvenience was the slight delay,
which in their restless mood tried their spirits to the
utmost. Captain Dawson muttered to himself and
urged his horse so angrily that he again placed himself
in advance. His mood was no more savage than that
of his companions, but he chafed at everything which
caused delay, no matter how trifling, in the pursuit.</p>
<p>Fearing that he might go wrong, Ruggles spurred up
beside him. The distance passed was less than any one
expected it to be, when Ruggles called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exclamation was caused by the hoofs of their
horses plashing in the water. They seemed to share
the impatience of their riders; &ldquo;all we have to do now
is to keep to the stream; obsarve its turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its course was almost at right angles to that which
they had been following. The animals were cantering
easily, when suddenly a deeper gloom than usual overspread
the valley like a pall. This came from a heavy
bank of clouds sweeping before the moon. The steeds
were drawn down to a walk, but the obscurity was not
dense enough to shut out the chasm-like opening, where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
the mountains seemed to part, riven by some terrific
convulsion ages before. The enormous walls drew back
the door as if to invite them to enter and press the pursuit
of the couple that were fleeing from a just and
righteous wrath.</p>
<p>The width of the ca&ntilde;on had now dwindled to a few
yards, and the stream expanding and shallow, occupied
so much of the space that the horses were continually
splashing through it, but the rise and fall of the trail
was so slight that the gallop might have continued with
little danger of mishap.</p>
<p>The formation of the party was in &ldquo;Indian file,&rdquo;
with Captain Dawson leading, Ruggles next and Brush
bringing up the rear. All three animals were walking,
for the light of the moon was variable and often faint,
while the danger of a mis-step was ever present, and
was likely to bring a fatal ending of the pursuit almost
before it had fairly begun. Occasionally the gloom in
the narrow gorge was so deep that they distinguished
one another&rsquo;s figures indistinctly, but the animals were
left mostly to themselves. They seemed to know what
was expected of them and showed no hesitation. It was
impossible for them to go wrong, for it was much the
same as if crossing a bridge, with its protecting barrier
on either hand. The horse of the captain showed
his self-confidence once or twice by a faint whinney
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
and a break from the walk into a trot, but his rider
checked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet; heaven knows that I am as anxious to
push on as you, but we have already made one blunder
and we can&rsquo;t afford another; when the time comes that
it is safe to trot you shall do so and perhaps run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; called Brush from the rear; &ldquo;I hear a
curious sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it seem to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to tell; let&rsquo;s stop for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the three animals stood motionless, the strange
noise was audible. It was a deep, hollow roar rapidly
increasing in volume and intensity, and resembled the
warning of a tornado or cyclone advancing through
the forest. The animals, as is the case at such times,
were nervous and frightened. They elevated their
heads, pricked their ears, snuffed the air and the animal
of the parson trembled with terror.</p>
<p>The three believed that something in the nature of a
cyclone was approaching, or it might be a cloudburst
several miles away, whose deluge had swollen the
stream into a rushing torrent that would overwhelm
them where they stood, caught inextricably in a trap.</p>
<p>The terrifying roar, however, was neither in front
nor at the rear, but above them,&ndash;&ndash;over their heads!
From the first warning to the end was but a few seconds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
The sound increased with appalling power and
every eye was instinctively turned upward.</p>
<p>In the dim obscurity they saw a dark mass of rock,
weighing hundreds of tons, descending like a prodigious
meteor, hurled from the heavens. It had been loosened
on the mountain crest a half mile above, and was
plunging downward with inconceivable momentum.
Striking some obstruction, it rebounded like a rubber
ball against the opposite side of the gorge, then recoiled,
still diving downward, oscillating like a pendulum from
wall to wall, whirling with increasing speed until it
crashed to the bottom of the gorge with a shock so terrific
that the earth and mountain trembled.</p>
<p>Landing in the stream, the water was flung like bird
shot right and left, stinging the faces of the men fifty
feet distant. They sat awed and silent until Ruggles
spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if that stone had hit one of us on the head it
would have hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably it would,&rdquo; replied the captain, who had
difficulty in quieting his horse; &ldquo;at any rate, I hope no
more of them will fall till we are out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether that could have been done on
purpose,&rdquo; remarked the parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ruggles; &ldquo;the leftenant couldn&rsquo;t know
anything about our being purty near the right
spot to catch it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I alluded to Indians,&ndash;&ndash;not to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ruggles and the captain did not deem such a
thing credible. A whole tribe of red men could not
have loosened so enormous a mass of stone, while, if
poised as delicately as it must have been, they would
have known nothing of the fact. Sometimes an immense
oak, sound and apparently as firm as any in the
forest around it, suddenly plunges downward and
crashes to the earth, from no imaginable cause. So,
vast masses of rock on the mountain side which have
held their places for centuries, seem to leap from their
foundations and tear their way with resistless force into
the valley below. This was probably one of those accidental
displacements, liable to occur at any hour of the
day or night, which had come so startlingly near crushing
the three men to death.</p>
<p>Captain Dawson drew a match from his pocket and
scraping it along his thigh, held it to the face of his
watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just midnight and we are not more than half a
dozen miles from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how far do you suppose <i>they</i> are?&rdquo; asked the
parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably five times as much, if not more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will not travel at night, and by sunrise we
ought to be considerably nearer to them than now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be certain about that. Lieutenant Russell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
knows me too well to loiter on the road; he has a good
horse and the pony of Nellie is a tough animal; both
will be urged to the utmost; for they must be sure the
pursuit will be a hard one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discomforting fact in the situation was that if
the fugitives, as they may be considered, pushed their
flight with vigor, there was no reason why they should
not prevent any lessening of the distance between them
and their pursuers, and since they would naturally fear
pursuit, it was to be expected that they would use all
haste. The hope was that on account of Nellie, the animals
would not keep up the flight for so many hours out
of the twenty-four, as the pursuers would maintain it.</p>
<p>The trail steadily ascended and became so rough and
uneven that the horses frequently stumbled. This made
their progress slow and compelled the three men, despite
themselves, to feel the prudence of resting until
daylight, but not one of them wished to do so, since
the night pursuit was the only phase of the business
which brought with it the belief that they were really
lessening the distance separating them from the two
in advance.</p>
<p>Eager as the couple were to get through the mountains
and reach Sacramento, where for the first time
they could feel safe from their pursuers, the young officer
was too wise to incur the risk of breaking down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
their horses, for such a mishap would be a most serious
one indeed, and fraught with fatal consequences.</p>
<p>There was little fear of the pursuers going astray.
Captain Dawson had an extraordinary memory for
places, as he repeatedly proved by recalling some landmark
that he had noticed on his previous trip. Furthermore,
the gorge was so narrow that in a certain
sense, it may be said, they were fenced in, and would
have found it hard to wander to the right or left, had
they made the effort.</p>
<p>After an hour of steady climbing they reached an altitude
which brought with it a sharp change of temperature.
The air became so chilly that Ruggles and Brush
flung their blankets about their shoulders and found the
protection added to their comfort. The horses, too, began
to show the effects of their severe exertion. Their
long rest had rendered them somewhat &ldquo;soft,&rdquo; though
the hardening would be rapid. After a few days&rsquo; work
they would not mind such exertion as that to which they
were now forced.</p>
<p>When a sort of amphitheatre was reached, it was decided
to draw rein for a brief while, out of sympathy
for their panting animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought if we failed to find our horses,&rdquo; remarked
the parson, &ldquo;we wouldn&rsquo;t find it hard to keep up the
pursuit on foot; I have changed my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked back over the sloping trail, which speedily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
vanished in the gloom and the eyes of the other two
were turned in the same direction. At the moment of
doing so, the animals again became frightened, so that,
despite their fatigue, it was hard to restrain them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something down there,&rdquo; remarked the captain
slipping from his saddle; &ldquo;Wade, you are the nearest,
can you see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruggles was out of the saddle in an instant, Winchester
in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I catched sight of something,&rdquo; he said in an undertone;
&ldquo;look after my horse, while I find out what it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care,&rdquo; cautioned the parson; &ldquo;it may be an
Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think it is,&rdquo; replied Ruggles, who instantly
started down the trail rifle in hand, his posture
a crouching one and his senses strung to the highest
point.</p>
<p>He passed from view almost on the instant, and his
companions listened with intense anxiety for what was
to follow. Suddenly the sharp crack of their friend&rsquo;s
rifle rang out in the solemn stillness, the report echoing
again and again through the gorge, with an effect that
was startling even to such experienced men. It was the
only sound that came to them, and, while they were
wondering what it meant, Ruggles reappeared among
them with the noiselessness of a shadow.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a bear,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;I think he scented
the animals and was follering on the lookout for a
chance at &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I did; he must have heard me comin&rsquo;
and was scared; he went down the trail faster than I
could; when I seen that I couldn&rsquo;t catch him, I let fly
without taking much aim. Maybe I hit him; leastways,
he traveled so much faster that I give it up and come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party lingered for half an hour more, but as the
horses showed no further fear, they concluded that
bruin had taken to heart the lesson he received and
would bother them no further.</p>
<p>The mountains still towered on every hand. The
stream had long since disappeared among the rocks and
the gorge had become narrower. Generally it was
no more than a dozen feet in width, occasionally expanding
to two or three times that extent. The moon
had moved over so far that only its faint reflection
against the dark walls and masses of rock availed the
horsemen. The sky seemed to contain an increasing
number of clouds and there were indications of a storm,
which might not break for a day or two, and as likely as
not would not break at all.</p>
<p>The traveling, despite its difficulty, was comparatively
safe. The trail did not lead along the sides of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
precipices, with a climbing wall on one side and a continuous
descent on the other, but it was solid and extended
across from one ridge to the other. Because of
this fact the three pushed their animals hard, knowing
that it would not be long before they would have to be
favored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether we are wise to keep this up
as we are doing,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;but I know there
are few places where we can travel in the darkness and
I feel like making the most of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a question of what the horses are able to
stand,&rdquo; replied Brush; &ldquo;it is easy enough for us to ride,
but a very different thing for them to carry us. We must
guard against their breaking down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will look out for that, but it is strange that when
we were making ready to start we forgot one important
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did not bring a mouthful of food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have little trouble in shooting what game
we need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not and perhaps we shall. The lieutenant
and I found on our way from Sacramento that, although
game appeared to be plenty, it had an exasperating
habit of keeping out of range when we particularly
needed it. Delay will be necessary to get food,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
and the reports of our guns are likely to give warning,
just when it is dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a bad slip,&rdquo; assented the parson; &ldquo;for there
was plenty of meat and bread at home; but we shall
have to stop now and then to rest our animals and to
allow them to feed and we can utilize such intervals by
getting something for ourselves in the same line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, so much as the risk of apprising the
two of their danger. In addition, it will be strange if
we get through the mountains without a fight with the
Indians. According to my recollection, we shall strike
a region to-morrow or on the next day, where there will
be the mischief to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two miles more of laborious work and another halt.
For the first time Parson Brush showed excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that some one is following
us? There may be several, but I am sure of one at
least and he is on a horse.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A CLOSE CALL</h3>
</div>
<p>Few situations are more trying than that of being
followed at night by what we suspect is an enemy. The
furtive glances to the rear show the foe too indistinctly
for us to recognize him, and the imagination pictures
the swift, stealthy attack and the treacherous blow
against which it is impossible to guard.</p>
<p>There was little of this dread, however, in the case
of our friends, for they felt strong enough to take care
of themselves. Moreover, all three formed an instant
suspicion of the identity of the man.</p>
<p>It was Felix Brush at the rear who first heard the
faint footfalls, and, peering into the gloom, saw the
outlines of a man and beast a few rods distant, coming
steadily up the trail in the same direction with himself.
A few minutes later the halt was made and all eyes were
turned toward the point whence the man was approaching.
He must have noticed the stoppage, but he came
straight on until he joined the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, pards,&rdquo; was his greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was you, Vose,&rdquo; said the captain,
sharply; &ldquo;what do you mean by following us?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What right have you to get in front of me? Don&rsquo;t
I have to make a trip to Sacramento three or four times
each year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not accustomed to start in the night
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I never knowed it was your custom to leave
New Constantinople in the middle of the night; leastways
I never knowed you to do it afore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have important business,&rdquo; added the captain
brusquely, uncertain as yet whether he ought to be displeased
or angered by the intrusion of Adams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you; explain yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t one of you three that knows the way
through the mountains, and if you undertook it alone,
it would take you three months to reach Sacramento.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a new and striking view of the situation,
but the parson said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each of us has been over it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartinly, but one trip nor half a dozen ain&rsquo;t enough.
You lost your way the first hour in Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch;
if you hadn&rsquo;t done so, it would have took me a blamed
sight longer to find you; there are half a dozen other
places in the mountains ten times worse than the one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
where you flew the track. Howsumever, if you don&rsquo;t
want me, I&rsquo;ll go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Vose Adams, as if his dignity had received a
mortal hurt, began turning his mule around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; interposed Captain Dawson; &ldquo;you have
put things in their true light; we are very glad to have
you with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it all right,&rdquo; was the cheery response
of the good natured Vose; &ldquo;I never like to push myself
where I ain&rsquo;t wanted, but as you seem glad to see me,
after having the thing explained, we won&rsquo;t say nothing
more about it. Howsumever, I may add that I obsarved
you started in such a hurry that I thought it
warn&rsquo;t likely you fetched any vittles with you, so I
made up a lunch and brought it with me, being as you
may not always have time to spare to shoot game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chilliness of Vose Adams&rsquo; greeting changed to
the warmest welcome. He had shown more thoughtfulness
than any of them, and his knowledge of the perilous
route through the mountains was beyond value.
Indeed, it looked as if it was to prove the deciding factor
in the problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know our business, Vose?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowed it the minute I seen you sneaking off like
shadows toward the trail. I hurried to my cabin, got a
lot of cold meat and bread together and then hunted up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
Hercules, my boss mule. He isn&rsquo;t very handsome, but
he has a fine voice and has been through these mountains
so many times that he knows the right road as well
as me. I knowed you would travel fast and didn&rsquo;t expect
to overhaul you afore morning, but you went past
the right turn and that give me a chance to catch up
sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how was it you suspected our errand?&rdquo; persisted
the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I help it? What else could it be? I
seen the miss and the leftenant start for Sacramento,
and being as you took the same course it was plain that
you was going there too, if you didn&rsquo;t overtake &rsquo;em
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw them start!&rdquo; thundered the father of Nellie
Dawson; &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you hurry off to me with the
news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I hurry off to you with the news?&rdquo;
coolly asked Vose Adams; &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t the first time I
had seen the two ride in that direction; sometimes she
was with you, or with the parson or Ruggles, and once
or twice with me. Would you have thought there was
anything wrong if you had seen them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&rdquo; replied the captain, seeing the
injustice of his words; &ldquo;but I have been so wrought up
by what has occurred that I can hardly think clearly. I
ask your pardon for my hasty words.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t do that, for I see how bad you feel and
I&rsquo;m sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was it they left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no one with them of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody except that big dog they call Timon; he
was frolicking &rsquo;round the horses, as if he enjoyed it as
much as them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every atom of news was painful, and yet the afflicted
father could not restrain himself from asking questions
of no importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what hour do you think it was when they
left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been near two o&rsquo;clock when the
leftenant fetched up his horse and the pony belonging
to the young lady. She must have been expectin&rsquo; him,
for she come right out of the house, without keeping
him waitin&rsquo; a minute. He helped her into the saddle,
while they talked and laughed as happy as could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was wormwood and gall to the parent, but he
did not spare himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you overhear anything said by them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have considered it proper to listen, even
if they hadn&rsquo;t been so far off I couldn&rsquo;t catch a word
that passed atween &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there anything in their actions to show they
intended to take a longer ride than usual?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how there could be,&rdquo; replied the puzzled
Adams, while Parson Brush, understanding what the
distraught captain meant, explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there anything in their appearance which suggested
that they meant to take anything more than an
ordinary gallop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of it at the time, but I can see now
there was. Each of them had what seemed to be extra
clothing and perhaps they had food, though I couldn&rsquo;t
make sure of that. You know there has been something
in the sky that looked like a coming storm, and
I thought it was on that account that the clothing was
took along. Then, as the leftenant had knocked off
work, it might be he was not feeling very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scoundrel made that very excuse for leaving
me,&rdquo; bitterly commented Captain Dawson, &ldquo;but he
wouldn&rsquo;t have taken the clothing as part of the same
design for there was no need of anything of the kind.
They laid their plans carefully and everything joined to
make it as easy as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your thoughts were precisely what ours would have
been,&rdquo; said the parson, drawn toward the messenger
unjustly accused by the captain in the tumult of his
grief;&ldquo; if we had seen the two start, we should have believed
it was for one of the usual gallops which the
young lady is so fond of taking; but, Vose, if we would
have certainly gone astray in the mountains, without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
your guidance, how will it be with them, when she has
never been over the trail and he has ridden over it but
once?&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are sure to have a tough time of it which will
make it all the harder for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some good luck may lead them right; more than
likely, howsumever, they&rsquo;ll get all wrong; therefore,
if we stick to the path we may pass &rsquo;em a half dozen
times. You see it&rsquo;s the blamed onsartinty of the whole
bus&rsquo;ness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not question your wisdom on such matters,
Vose, but when I remember that each of them is
riding a horse, and that the two must leave traces behind
them, I cannot apprehend that we shall go very
far astray in our pursuit. The most likely trouble as
it seems to me is that they will travel so fast that it will
be almost impossible to overtake them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they can manage to keep to the trail, it is going
to be hard work to come up with them. You haven&rsquo;t
forgot that when I&rsquo;m pushing through the mountains I
sometimes have to hunt a new trail altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is due to the trouble with Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely; sometimes it&rsquo;s a long, roundabout course
that I have to take, which may keep me off the main
course for a couple of days, or it may be for only a part
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
of the day, but Injins is something that you must count
on every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they are as likely to meet them as we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More so, &rsquo;cause they&rsquo;re just ahead of you. Oh, it
was the biggest piece of tomfoolery ever heard of for
them to start on such a journey, but what are you to expect
of two young persons dead in love with each
other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not the kind of talk that was pleasing to the
father, and he became morosely silent. It was equally
repugnant to Ruggles and the parson to hear Nellie
Dawson referred to as being in love with the execrated
officer. Ruggles was grim and mute, and the parson
deftly drew the conversation in another direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to ask you, Vose, how it was that Lieutenant
Russell did not take the other horses with him,
so as to make it impossible for anything in the nature of
pursuit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be two reasons; he may have thought
it would be mean to hit you below the belt like that; he
was too honorable&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It warn&rsquo;t anything like <i>that</i>,&rdquo; fiercely interrupted
Ruggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must have been that if he had took all the
animals with him, even though they was a considerable
way down the gulch, the thing would have been noticed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
by others, who would have wanted to know what it
meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you have struck the right reason. Had
the start been in the night time, he would have made
sure that not even the mules were left for us. But,
Vose,&rdquo; added the parson gravely, &ldquo;we would be much
better pleased if when you referred to the lieutenant,
you said nothing about &lsquo;honor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am as much down on him as any of you,&rdquo;
airily responded Vose; &ldquo;and, if I git the chance to draw
bead on him, I&rsquo;ll do it quicker&rsquo;n lightning. Fact is, the
hope of having that same heavenly privilege was as
strong a rope in pulling me up the trail after you as
was the wish to keep you folks from gettin&rsquo; lost. But,
pards, Hercules is rested and I guess likely your animals
are the same, so let&rsquo;s be moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Captain Dawson had been silent during the
last few minutes, he did not allow a word to escape him.
He knew Vose Adams was talkative at times, due perhaps
to his enjoyment of company, after being forced
to spend weeks without exchanging a word with any
one of his kind, but there was no overestimating his
value, because of his knowledge of the long, dangerous
route through the mountains. When, therefore, the
party were about to move on, the captain said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vose, from this time forward you are the guide;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
the place for you is at the head; you will oblige me by
taking the lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vose accepted the post of honor, which was also the
one of peril, for it is the man in his position whose life
hangs in the balance when Indians are concerned. But
there was no hesitancy on his part, though he was well
aware of the additional risks he incurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one good thing I can tell you,&rdquo; he said,
just before they started.</p>
<p>They looked inquiringly at him and he explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hardest part of the climbing is over,&ndash;&ndash;that is
for the time,&rdquo; he hastened to add, seeing that he was
not understood; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have plenty more of it before
we see Sacramento, but I mean that we have struck the
highest part of the trail, and it will be a good while before
there&rsquo;s any more climbing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good news,&rdquo; said Ruggles heartily, &ldquo;for it
has been mighty tough on the animals; I &rsquo;spose too, the
trail is smoother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adams laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say it&rsquo;s rougher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruggles muttered impatiently, but the four took up
the task, Adams in the lead, with the rest stringing
after him in Indian file. The declaration of Vose was
verified sooner than was expected. While the mule was
so sure-footed that he seemed to meet with no difficulty,
it was excessively trying to the horses, who stumbled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
and recovered themselves so often that Captain Dawson
began to fear one or more of them would go lame.
Still in his anxiety to get forward, he repressed his
fears, hoping that there would be some improvement
and cheering himself with the belief that since all had
gone well for so long, it would continue on the same
line.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Once, however, his horse made such an abrupt stumble
that the captain narrowly saved himself from being
unseated. On the impulse of the moment he called to
Adams in advance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vose, I am afraid this won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader did not look around and acted as if he
had not heard him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Vose, isn&rsquo;t it better that we should wait till
our horses can see the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the leader took no notice of this demand, the
captain concluded his fears were groundless and said no
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he thinks it safe for us to keep on, I shall not
oppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Captain Dawson might have opposed, had he
known the truth, for, strange as it may seem, Vose
Adams did not hear the words addressed to him, because
he was asleep on the back of his mule Hercules,
as he had been many a time while riding over the lonely
trail. In truth, there was some foundation for his declaration
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
that he could sleep more soundly on the back
of his animal than while wrapped up in his blanket in
some fissure among the rocks. Fortunately for him,
however, these naps were of short duration, and, while
indulging in them, he relied upon his animal, which had
acquired a wonderful quickness in detecting danger.
The slightest lagging in his gait, a halt, a turning to one
side or a whinny was sufficient to bring back on the instant
the wandering senses of the rider. In the present
instance his slumber was not interrupted until Hercules,
seeing exactly where he was, dropped his walk
to a lagging gait.</p>
<p>On the very second Vose Adams opened his eyes. So
naturally that no one suspected anything, he checked his
animal and looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pards, we&rsquo;ve reached a ticklish spot, and it&rsquo;s for
you to say whether we shall wait for daylight afore trying
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is its nature?&rdquo; asked the captain, as he and
the two behind him also reined up their animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trail winds through these peaks in front, and
instead of being like that we&rsquo;ve been riding over all
along, keeps close to the side of the mountain. On the
right is the solid rock, and on the left it slopes down for
I don&rsquo;t know how many hundred feet, afore it strikes
bottom. Once started down that slide, you&rsquo;ll never stop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
till you hit the rocks below like that mass of stone that
tumbled over in front of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wide is the path?&rdquo; asked the parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than a mile where it isn&rsquo;t wide
enough for two of us to ride abreast, and there are
plenty of places where a horse has got to step mighty
careful to save himself. Hercules knows how to do it,
for he larned long ago, but I have my doubts about your
hosses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been better after all if we had
brought the mules,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, for Hercules is the only one that
knows how to git over such places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do the others manage it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve never tried it in the night time; that&rsquo;s what
I&rsquo;m talking &rsquo;bout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adams&rsquo;s description enabled the others to recall the
place. It was all that had been pictured and they
might well pause before assuming the fearful risk. One
reason for wishing to press forward was the knowledge
that at the termination of the dangerous stretch, the
trail was so smooth and even that for a long distance
it would be easy to keep their animals at a gallop, while
still further the peril appeared again.</p>
<p>Captain Dawson once more struck a match and
looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-past three; in two hours it will begin to grow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
light; if no accident happens we shall be at the end of
the ugly piece of ground by that time, where the traveling
is good. It is a pity to lose the opportunity, but
I will leave it to you, parson and Ruggles; what do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our horses have been pushed pretty hard, but they
are in good condition. I hate to remain idle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you favor going ahead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Ruggles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it; lead on, Vose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as well suited, but keep your wits about
you,&rdquo; was the warning of the leader, whose mule instantly
responded, stretching his neck forward and
downward and occasionally snuffing the ground, as if
he depended on his sense of smell more than that of
hearing.</p>
<p>The task was a nerve-wrenching one, and more than
once each of the three regretted their haste in not waiting
for daylight; but, having started, there was no turning
back. To attempt to wheel about, in order to retrace
their steps, was more perilous than to push on,
while to stand still was hardly less dangerous.</p>
<p>The moonlight gave such slight help that the four depended
almost wholly upon the instinct of their animals.
Hercules never faltered, but advanced with the slow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
plodding, undeviating certainty of those of his kind
who thread their way through the treacherous passes
of the Alps. Once his hind hoof struck a stone which
went bounding down the precipice on his left, until at
the end of what seemed several minutes, it lay still at
the bottom. Neither animal nor rider showed the least
fear, for in truth both were accustomed to little slips
like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m blessed if this isn&rsquo;t the most ticklish business
that I ever attempted,&rdquo; muttered Captain Dawson; &ldquo;I
never had anything like it in the army; it reminds me
of scouting between the lines, when you expect every
second a bullet from a sharpshooter&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant his horse stepped on a round, loose
stone which turned so quickly that before he could recover
himself the hoof followed the stone over the edge
of the precipice. The horse snorted and struggled
desperately, and the brave rider felt an electric shock
thrill through him from head to foot, for there was one
moment when he believed nothing could save them
from the most frightful of deaths.</p>
<p>The left hind leg had gone over the rocky shelf,
which at that point was very narrow, and the hoof was
furiously beating vacancy in the despairing effort to
find something upon which to rest itself. His body
sagged downward and the rider held his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, my boy!&rdquo; he called, and with rare presence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
of mind allowed the rein to lie free so as not to
disconcert the steed.</p>
<p>The tremendous struggle of the intelligent animal
prevailed and with a snort he recovered his balance and
all four feet stood upon firm support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a close call,&rdquo; observed the parson, whose
heart was in his mouth, while the brief fight for life was
going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so close that it couldn&rsquo;t have been any
closer,&rdquo; coolly commented the captain, fully himself
again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>A COLLISION</h3>
</div>
<p>At this moment, the cheery voice of Adams called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only about a hundred yards more of this,
but we&rsquo;ve now struck the worst part of the whole trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is any worse than what we have just passed,
it won&rsquo;t do to try it,&rdquo; replied Captain Dawson, with the
memory of his recent thrilling experience still vivid
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do it, but we must foller a different plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must lead our animals. There are plenty of
places where you can get off your horses with more
comfort, but we can&rsquo;t stand here doing nothing. Get
to the ground the best way you know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was clear that the advice of the guide would have
to be followed, and all four set about the task with the
cool daring shown from the first. Since each man was
to lead his animal, it was necessary to dismount in
front, instead of slipping over the tail, as would have
been easier. The beasts showed striking sagacity in
this delicate task. The trail was so narrow that to dismount
to the left, on the side of the dizzying precipice,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
made it impossible for a man to keep his poise, while
to descend on the right, directly beside the body of the
animal was almost certain to crowd him over into the
gorge. Each, therefore, lowered himself with infinite
care over the right shoulder of his steed, so well forward,
that the horse by turning his head to the left afforded
just enough room for the trick to be done. Every
one dismounted in safety, each drawing a breath of relief
when the exquisitely delicate task was accomplished.</p>
<p>Looking around in the gloom, Vose Adams saw that
his friends stood on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all ready?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Brush from the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold the bridle so gentle that you can let go if
your animal slips off: if he has to go over the precipice,
there&rsquo;s no need of your follering him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each man took his Winchester in hand, and loosely
grasping the bridle rein, began stealing forward, the
captain&rsquo;s loss compelling him to make his single arm
answer for both purposes. The advance was necessarily
slow, for it was made with the utmost care. The
path could not have been more dangerous than for the
brief stretch between them and the broad, safe support
beyond.</p>
<p>Several times the trail so narrowed that each trembled
through fear of not being able to keep his balance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
while it seemed absolutely impossible for a horse to do
so; but one of the strange facts connected with that intelligent
animal is that, despite his greater bulk, he is
generally able to follow wherever his master leads. So
it was that when a miner carefully turned his head, he
saw his steed following slowly but unfalteringly in his
footsteps.</p>
<p>It was soon perceived that this perilous stretch did
not take a straight course, but assumed the form of an
immense, partial circle. When half way around, the
plodders came in sight of a huge rent in the distant
mountain wall, through which the sky showed nearly
from the zenith to the horizon. In this immense
V-shaped space shone the moon nearly at its full, and
without a rift or fleck of cloud in front of its face.</p>
<p>A flood of light streamed through and between the
encompassing peaks, tinging the men and animals with
its fleecy veil, as if some of the snow from the crests
had been sprinkled over them. On their left, the craggy
wall sloped almost vertically downward, the projecting
masses of rock displaying the same, fairy-like covering,
ending in a vast, yawning pit of night and blackness,
into whose awful depth the human eye could not penetrate.</p>
<p>On the right, the mass of stone, rock and boulder,
rugged, broken and tumbled together, as if flung about
by giants in sport, towered beyond the vision&rsquo;s reach,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
the caverns, abysses and hollows made the blacker and
more impenetrable by the moonlight glinting against
the protruding masses.</p>
<p>It was as if a party of Titans had run their chisels
along the flinty face of the mountain from the rear,
gouging out the stone, with less and less persistency,
until they reached the spot where the men and animals
were creeping forward, when the dulled tools scarcely
made an impression sufficient to support the hesitating
feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dawson was but a few paces to the rear of
Vose Adams&rsquo;s mule, whose surety of step he admired
and tried to imitate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Training seems able to accomplish anything,&rdquo; reflected
the captain; &ldquo;I remember how Lieutenant Russell
and I stopped on the further edge of this infernal
place when we reached it one forenoon and spent several
hours trying to find a safer path. It kept us in a
tremor until we were across. Had any one told me that
on the next journey I should try it in the night, I would
have believed him crazy, but,&rdquo; he grimly added, &ldquo;I
would have thought the same, if I had been told that a
necessity like this would compel us to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bridle rein was looped over his elbow, which extended
behind him, the same hand grasping his rifle,
so that he advanced partly sideways over the treacherous
trail. He attempted to do nothing but look after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
his own footsteps. Sometimes, when it was a little
harder to pull the rein, he slackened his pace. It would
not do to hurry the animal, since a slight disturbance
might cause him to loose his footing. The horse knew
what was required of him and would do it better by
being left wholly to himself.</p>
<p>It was because of this concentration of his mind upon
the one thing that the captain failed to perceive that the
mule in his front had stopped walking, until the rim of
his slouched hat touched the tail of the motionless animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helloa, Vose, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide said something, but kept his face turned
away, and his words, instead of being in the nature of
an answer, were addressed to some one who confronted
him. Adams was of slight stature, so that, although he
stood erect, it was easy for the captain to look over his
head and see what was beyond. That which was thus
revealed was another horseman leading his animal and
coming toward them. He was advancing in the same
manner as the miners, that is by leading his horse, and,
meeting our friends thus face to face, it was impossible
for either party to pass: one or the other must give way
and retreat.</p>
<p>A startling feature of this meeting was that the individual
who thus confronted them was an Indian of
gigantic stature. He was more than six feet in height
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
and of massive proportions. He belonged to what were
known as the &ldquo;mountain Indians,&rdquo; who were brave and
of irrestrainable ferocity. They were the most dangerous
people met by the miners in the early days on the
Pacific slope.</p>
<p>Equity demanded that this particular specimen
should back his horse over the few yards to the point
where the trail broadened, for the task was possible
of accomplishment, while the white men were unable
to force their animals in safety for one-half of the distance
behind them. Moreover, it was evident that this
Indian had deliberately started over the trail, with the
knowledge of the four white men approaching, so that
a meeting was inevitable. He courted an encounter
with them and was in a murderous mood.</p>
<p>Vose Adams knew all this and recognized the warrior
as one of the dreaded Indians, with whom he was
better acquainted than were his friends. He had had
several scrimmages with them on his trips through the
mountains, and held them in such wholesome fear that
he contrived to avoid a direct conflict. The diminutive
miner overflowed with pluck, but in a hand to hand
encounter, must be only a child in the grasp of the
aboriginal giant. The present situation, however, was
peculiar.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that this savage sought the
meeting with the party, for on no other supposition can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
his acts be explained. He must have reasoned that on
the narrow ledge his enemies would have to meet him
one by one and engage him single handed. He was
like a chamois that had lived all its life in these wild
solitudes and was surer-footed than any white man.
What a triumph it would be (and was it unreasonable
to expect it?) for him to slay the insignificant pale face
immediately in his front, shove his mule over the precipice,
and then serve the remaining three in same fashion!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of this!&rdquo; were the words which Vose
Adams addressed to the Indian, directly after the question
of Captain Dawson to himself, and when the enemies
were within six feet of each other; &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t
room for both of us; you knew that before you started;
one of us has got to give way and I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the red man did not understand a word
of English, it is not to be supposed that he grasped the
whole meaning of this command, but the situation must
have made it evident that he had been ordered to back
his horse and to open a way for the white men, and inasmuch
as he had come upon the trail for the express
purpose of bringing about this encounter, it seems
hardly necessary to say that he failed to obey the order.
Instead, he repeated some words in his own language,
which it is not unlikely were of the same import as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
those addressed to him, for he resolutely maintained
his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; added Vose, raising his voice, as if that
could help make his meaning clear; &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t do
as I say, somebody is going to get hurt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warrior, who was carrying a rifle, stooped and
gently let it fall beside him. At the same moment he
let go of the thong which served as a bridle. Thus both
hands were free and he crouched down with his hideous
face thrust forward and took a slow, half-step toward
Adams.</p>
<p>The coarse black hair dangling loosely about his
shoulders, the broad frightful countenance, which, however,
was devoid of paint, the glittering, basilisk-like
eyes, the sinewy half-bent finger, with the right fingers
closed like a vise around the handle of the knife at his
waist, while gently drawing it forth, the catlike advance,&ndash;&ndash;all
these made him so terrible an enemy that
the bravest man might well doubt the result of a meeting
with him.</p>
<p>And yet the closest scrutiny of Vose Adams would
not have discovered any tremor in his frame, or so
much as a blanching of his face. He fully comprehended
the nature of the peril that impended, but with
the cool readiness of a veteran, he had fixed upon his
line of action, in the same moment that he read the purpose
of his formidable enemy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>The preliminary actions of the guide were similar
to that of the warrior. The bridle rein dropped from
his hand, and, slightly stooping, he let his Winchester
fall to the ground beside him. Then his knife flashed
out and he was ready.</p>
<p>Since only the mule was between Captain Dawson
and the combatants, he observed all this and interpreted
its meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vose, what do you mean to do?&rdquo; he sharply asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a little dispute with the fellow,&rdquo; replied
Adams, without removing his gaze from the face of
the savage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sorter looks as if it can&rsquo;t be helped, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain had laid down his rifle and drawn his
revolver, in the use of which he was an expert. While
thus engaged, he stooped down, so that the interposing
body of the mule, prevented the Indian from observing
what he was doing. When his weapon was ready and
just as he uttered his last word, he straightened up like
a flash. Adams being of short stature and in a stooping
posture, gave him just the chance he needed. His single
arm was extended with the quickness of lightning
and he fired. The bullet bored its way through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
bronzed skull of the Indian, who, with an ear-splitting
screech, flung his arms aloft, leaped several feet from
the ground, toppled sideways over the edge of the trail
and went tumbling, rolling and doubling down the
precipice far beyond sight, into the almost fathomless
abyss below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call a low down trick!&rdquo; was the disgusted
exclamation of Adams, looking round with a
reproachful expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you refer to the Indian?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; to you; I had just got ready for him and had
everything fixed when you interfered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vose, you are a fool,&rdquo; was the comment of his
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow was twice as big as you and you hadn&rsquo;t
an earthly chance in a fight with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you &rsquo;spose that is the first time I ever met a
mountain Injin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never fought one of that size in this spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What difference does the spot make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to understand,&rdquo; said the captain with
assumed gravity, &ldquo;that I didn&rsquo;t interfere out of any
regard for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the mischief are you driving at?&rdquo; demanded
the puzzled guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under ordinary circumstances, I would have stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
by and watched the flurry, only wishing that the best
man might win. That means, of course, that you would
have been the loser. But we need some one to guide
us through the mountains; you haven&rsquo;t done it yet;
when your work is over you may go and live on wild
Indians for all I care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vose quickly regained his good nature. He returned
his knife to its resting place, picked up his rifle, grasped
the bridle rein and gently pulled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Hercules; I don&rsquo;t know whether they appreciate
us or not; steady now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with that horse in front
of you?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it! if I didn&rsquo;t forget about him; back with
you!&rdquo; he commanded with a gesture, moving toward
the animal, who showed the intelligence of his kind, by
retrograding carefully until he reached the broad safe
place so anxiously sought by the others. There he
wheeled and trotted off, speedily disappearing from
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vose, you might have traded Hercules for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much! I wouldn&rsquo;t give that mule for a drove
of horses that have belonged to these mountain Injins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with them? Aren&rsquo;t they as
good as ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re too good; you can&rsquo;t tell what trick they&rsquo;ll
sarve you; I was once riding through these very mountains,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
on the back of a horse that I picked up&ndash;&ndash;it isn&rsquo;t
necessary to say how&ndash;&ndash;when his owner gave a signal
and the critter was off like a thunderbolt. If I hadn&rsquo;t
slipped from his back at the risk of breaking my neck,
he would have carried me right into a camp of hostiles
and you would have been without your invaluable guide
on this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is important information&ndash;&ndash;if true&ndash;&ndash;helloa!
it is growing light off there in the east!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&ndash;&ndash;day is breaking,&rdquo; added Vose.</p>
<p>The captain looked at his watch and found the time
considerably past five o&rsquo;clock. They had been longer
on the road than any one supposed, and the coming of
morning was a vast relief to all.</p>
<p>The party were now grouped together, for the trail
was broad and safe. Parson Brush asked, as he pointed
almost directly ahead:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a light off yonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide gazed in that direction and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it comes from a camp fire, which isn&rsquo;t
more than a half mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men looked in one another&rsquo;s faces and the captain
asked in a guarded voice, as if afraid of being overheard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose fire is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no saying with any sartinty, till we get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
closer, but I shouldn&rsquo;t be &rsquo;sprised if it belong to the
folks you&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same thought had come to each. There was a
compression of lips, a flashing of eyes and an expression
of resolution that boded ill for him who was the
cause of it all.</p>
<p>In the early morning at this elevation, the air was
raw and chilling. The wind which blew fitfully brought
an icy touch from the peaks of the snow-clad Sierras.
The party had ridden nearly all night, with only comparatively
slight pauses, so that the men would have
welcomed a good long rest but for the startling discovery
just made.</p>
<p>Over the eastern cliffs the sky was rapidly assuming
a rosy tinge. Day was breaking and soon the wild region
would be flooded with sunshine. Already the gigantic
masses of stone and rock were assuming grotesque
form in the receding gloom. The dismal night
was at an end.</p>
<p>The twinkling light which had caught the eye of
Felix Brush appeared to be directly ahead and near the
trail which they were traveling. This fact strengthened
the belief that the fire had been kindled by the
fugitives. The illumination paled as the sun climbed
the sky, until it was absorbed by the overwhelming radiance
that was everywhere.</p>
<p>The pursuers felt well rewarded for the energy they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
had displayed in the face of discouragement and danger.
Valuable ground had been gained, and even now
when they had supposed they were fully a dozen miles
behind the fugitives, it looked as if they had really
caught up to them, or at least were within hailing distance.</p>
<p>Every eye was fixed on the point which held so intense
an interest for them. As the day grew, a thin,
wavy column of smoke was observed ascending from
the camp fire, which was partly hidden among a growth
of scrub cedars, some distance to the right of the trail,
whither it must have been difficult for the couple to
force their horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That leftenant ought to have knowed better than
to do that,&rdquo; remarked Vose Adams, &ldquo;his fire can be
seen a long way off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else could they do?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rocks give all the cover he needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they could have no idea that we were so near,&rdquo;
suggested the parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, but the leftenant had &rsquo;nough &rsquo;sperience
with Injins on his way through here before to
know he&rsquo;s liable to run agin them at any time. I never
dared to do a thing like that on my trips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s push on,&rdquo; said the captain, who saw no reason
for tarrying now that they had located the game.</p>
<p>The ground was so much more favorable that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
animals were forced to a canter, though all were in
need of rest. Little was said, and Captain Dawson
spurred forward beside Adams, who as usual was leading.</p>
<p>Wade Ruggles and Parson Brush also rode abreast.
They were far enough to the rear to exchange a few
words without being overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the way things look,&rdquo; said Brush; &ldquo;we shall
have to leave everything with the captain and he isn&rsquo;t
likely to give us anything to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad clean through; I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;leve he&rsquo;ll wait to
say a word, but the minute he can draw bead on the
leftenant, he&rsquo;ll let fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a fine marksman, but he may be in such a
hurry that he&rsquo;ll miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear of that; I wonder,&rdquo; added Ruggles, startled
by a new thought, &ldquo;whether Vose has any idee of
stickin&rsquo; in his oar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must git a chance to warn him that we won&rsquo;t
stand any nonsense like that! The best that we&rsquo;ll do
is to promise him a chance for a crack after you and me
miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be any chance at all,&rdquo; grimly remarked
the parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;ll have and he mustn&rsquo;t forgit it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
There&rsquo;s some things I won&rsquo;t stand and that&rsquo;s one of
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything now, but we may have a
chance to notify him. If the opportunity comes to me,
he shall not remain ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were now nearly opposite the camp and the two
noticed with surprise that Adams and the captain were
riding past it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that fur?&rdquo; asked the puzzled Ruggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to prevent them from fleeing toward Sacramento.
When they find we are on the other side, they
will have to turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was apparently the purpose of the men in advance,
for they did not draw rein until a hundred yards
beyond the camp. Suddenly the two halted, and half-facing
around, waited until Brush and Ruggles joined
them. The explanation of the guide showed that his
plan had been rightly interpreted by Parson Brush.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE CAMP FIRE</h3>
</div>
<p>The trail, as has been stated, was broad and comparatively
level. The slope of the mountain to the
right was so moderate that it could be climbed by a
horse almost as readily as by a man. Its face was covered
with a growth of cedars, continuing half way to
the summit, when it terminated, only bleak masses of
rock, sprinkled with snow, whose volume increased
with the elevation, being visible above and beyond.</p>
<p>When the four pursuers came together, their faces
showed that they comprehended the serious business
before them. It was seen that Captain Dawson was
slightly pale, but those who had been with him in battle
had observed the same peculiarity. Accompanied,
as it was in this instance, by a peculiar steely glitter of
his eyes, it meant that he was in a dangerous mood and
the man who crossed his path did so at his peril.</p>
<p>It was evident that he and Vose Adams had reached
an understanding during the few minutes that they
were riding in advance. The words of Vose Adams
were spoken for the benefit of Ruggles and the parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wait here till I take a look at things.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do?&rdquo; asked Brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up the slope on foot to find out how the
land lays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you find that out, what next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is to come back and report to me,&rdquo; interposed
the captain.</p>
<p>There was a world of meaning in these words. It
showed that the captain allowed Adams to lead only
when acting as a guide. In all other matters, the retired
officer assumed control. The opportunity of Vose
to pick off the offending lieutenant promised to be better
than that of any one else, since he would first see
him, but he had been given to understand that he must
immediately return and let the captain know the situation.
Adams had promised this and he knew Dawson
too well to dare to thwart him.</p>
<p>Brush and Ruggles could make no objection, keen
though their disappointment was. They watched
Adams, as he slipped off his mule, not deeming it worth
while to utter the warning both had had in mind. It
was the parson who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we have nothing to do except to wait
here till you come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way, but you must ask the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be gone long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, but there&rsquo;s no need of waiting,&rdquo; said
the captain.</p>
<p>The three watched the guide until he disappeared
from sight among the cedars, when the captain added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vose told me that it was possible that camp fire
had been started by Indians, but it seems to me there
is little likelihood of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those people are so skilled in woodcraft that they
would have been on the alert against our approach, for
a brief survey of the trail for the last half hour would
have revealed us to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; suggested the parson, &ldquo;that with every
reason to believe there is no danger of anything of the
kind, for it must be rare that a white man passes along
this trail, they did not keep a lookout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I know of the American race, it is unlike
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What knowledge have we that they have not maintained
such a lookout and discovered us as soon as we
noticed the camp fire itself? They may have formed
an ambuscade at some point further along the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a disturbing possibility and I would be
alarmed, but for my confidence in Vose. He has been
through this region so often and knows these wild people
so thoroughly that he could not commit a blunder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
like that. It seems to me,&rdquo; added the captain a few
minutes, later, &ldquo;that he is absent a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough,&rdquo; remarked Ruggles, &ldquo;that things are
fixed so we won&rsquo;t have a chance to take any hand in
this bus&rsquo;ness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain looked inquiringly at him and he explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Vose have set it up atween you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you that if your help is needed, it will
be welcome; I can add nothing to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain is right,&rdquo; interposed the parson, &ldquo;but
at the same time, he can see what a disappointment it is
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit that, but we are not out of the woods yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could make clear the meaning of this remark,
Vose Adams emerged from the cedars, and the
three breathlessly awaited his coming. He broke into
a trot and quickly descended the slope to where they
stood. The expression of his face showed before he
spoke that he brought unwelcome news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it!&rdquo; he exclaimed with a shake of his
head, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they have gone on up the trail,&rdquo; said the captain
inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; they haven&rsquo;t been there; it isn&rsquo;t their camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Injins; there are five of &rsquo;em; they&rsquo;ve just had their
breakfast and are gettin&rsquo; ready to make a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the way I do bus&rsquo;ness,&rdquo; replied Vose
rather loftily; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n likely, howsumever, they
seen us all awhile ago when we was further down the
trail. They&rsquo;re traveling eastward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you know that?&rdquo; asked the parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Injin that took his dive off the trail &rsquo;bout the
time the captain fired off his revolver, was going that
way. He b&rsquo;longed to the party and was sorter leading
&rsquo;em; he was a chief or something of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are their ponies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t any,&ndash;&ndash;leastways he was the only one
that had, which is why I said he was some kind of a
chief. We shall hear from &rsquo;em agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean after they find out about that little row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why need they find out about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t help it; they&rsquo;ll miss their chief; they&rsquo;ll
run across that horse of his and that&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em the
clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This unexpected discovery put a new face on matters.
Five mountain Indians, the bravest and most implacable
of their race, were almost within stone&rsquo;s throw
of the party. But for the occurrence of a brief while
before, they probably would have permitted the white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
men to continue their journey unmolested, since the
strength of the two bands, all things considered, was
about equal, but when the hostiles learned of the death
of their leader, they would bend every effort toward
securing revenge. They would dog the miners, watchful,
alert and tireless in their attempts to cut them off
from the possibility of ever repeating the deed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that chief, as you seem to think he was,&rdquo; said
Captain Dawson, &ldquo;is gone as utterly as if the ground
had opened and swallowed him. They will never have
the chance to officiate at his funeral, so how are they to
learn of the manner of his taking off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take &rsquo;em long,&rdquo; replied Adams; &ldquo;his pony
will hunt them out, now that he is left to himself; that&rsquo;ll
tell &rsquo;em that something is up and they&rsquo;ll start an investigatin&rsquo;
committee. The footprints of our horses, the
marks on the rocks, which you and me wouldn&rsquo;t notice,
the fact that we met the chief on that narrer ledge and
that he&rsquo;s turned up missing will soon lay bare the whole
story, and as I remarked aforesaid, we shall hear from
&rsquo;em agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a case of the hunter hunting the tiger,&rdquo;
said the parson, &ldquo;and then awaking to the fact that the
tiger is engaged in hunting him; it is plain to see that
there&rsquo;s going to be a complication of matters, but I
don&rsquo;t feel that it need make any difference to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; replied the captain decisively; &ldquo;we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
haven&rsquo;t put our hands to the plough with any intention
of looking back. What&rsquo;s the next thing to do, Vose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to look after our animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no grass here for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little further and we&rsquo;ll strike a stream of water
where we&rsquo;ll find some grass, though not much, but it&rsquo;s
better than nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vaulting into the saddle, the guide after some pounding
of his heels against the iron ribs of Hercules, forced
him into a gallop, which the others imitated. The trail
continued comparatively smooth, and, being slightly descending,
the animals were not crowded as hard as it
would seem. A mile of this brought them to the water,
where they were turned loose. The stream gushed
from the mountain side, and, flowing across the trail,
was lost among the rocks to the left. The moisture
thus diffused produced a moderate growth of tough,
coarse grass, which the animals began plucking as soon
as the bits were removed from their mouths. They secured
little nutriment, but as the guide remarked, it
was an improvement upon nothing. The men bathed
their faces in the cold, clear water, took a refreshing
draught, and then ate the lunch provided for them by
the thoughtful Adams. Though they ate heartily, sufficient
was kept to answer for another meal or two, if it
should be thought wise to put themselves on an allowance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>They had just lighted their pipes, when Wade Ruggles
uttered an exclamation. Without explaining the
cause, he bounded to his feet and ran several rods to
the westward, where he was seen to stoop and pick
something from the ground. He examined it closely
and then, as he turned about and came back more
slowly it was perceived that he held a white handkerchief
in his hand. His action caused the others to rise
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you there?&rdquo; asked Captain Dawson,
suspecting its identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you have seen it before,&rdquo; replied Wade,
handing the piece of fine, bordered linen to him. He
turned it over with strange emotions, for he was quick
to recognize it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, compressing his lips; &ldquo;it is hers;
she dropped it there&ndash;&ndash;how long ago, Vose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter examined the handkerchief, as if looking
for the answer to the question in its folds, but shook
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even a mountain Injin could not tell that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parson asked the privilege of examining the article.
His heart was beating fast, though no one else
was aware of it, for it was a present which he had made
to Nellie Dawson on the preceding Christmas, having
been brought by Vose Adams, with other articles, on
his trip made several months before the presentation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
There was the girl&rsquo;s name, written by himself in indelible
ink, and in his neat, round hand. It was a bitter
reflection that it had been in her possession, when she
was in the company of the one whom she esteemed
above all others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been,&rdquo; reflected the parson, carefully
keeping his thoughts to himself, &ldquo;that, when she remembered
from whom it came, she flung it aside to
please him. Captain,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;since this was once
mine, I presume you have no objection to my keeping
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome to it; I don&rsquo;t care for it,&rdquo; replied
the parent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; and the parson carefully put it away
to keep company with the letter of Nellie Dawson
which broke her father&rsquo;s heart; &ldquo;I observe that it is
quite dry, which makes me believe it has not been exposed
to the dew, and therefore could not have lain long
on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell anything by that,&rdquo; commented Vose;
&ldquo;the air is so dry up here, even with the snow and water
around us, that there&rsquo;s no dew to amount to anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All seemed to prefer not to discuss the little incident
that had produced so sombre an effect upon the party.
Wade Ruggles was disposed to claim the handkerchief,
inasmuch as it was he who found it, but he respected
the feelings of the parson too much to make any protest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>The occurrence was of no special interest to the guide.
He had said they were in danger from the Indians and
he gave his thoughts to them. While the others kept
their seats on the ground, he stood erect, and, shading
his eyes with one hand, peered long and attentively over
the trail behind them. The clump of cedars from amid
which the thin column of vapor was slowly climbing
into the sky and the narrow ledge which had been the
scene of their stirring adventure were in view, though
its winding course shut a portion from sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected it!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Vose.</p>
<p>The others followed the direction of his gaze and
saw what had caused his words. The five Indians,
whom Vose had discovered in camp, were picking their
way along the ledge, with their faces turned from the
white men, who were watching them. Despite the
chilly air, caused by the elevation, not one of the warriors
wore a blanket. Two had bows and arrows, three
rifles, carried in a trailing fashion, and all were lithe,
sinewy fellows, able to give a good account of themselves
in any sort of fight.</p>
<p>A curious fact noted by all of our friends was that
while these warriors were thus moving away, not one of
them looked behind him. Their long black hair hung
loosely about their shoulders, and in the clear air it
was observable that three wore stained feathers in the
luxuriant growth on their crowns.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that they have no suspicion of us?&rdquo;
asked the parson; &ldquo;their action in not looking around
would imply that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fool yourself,&rdquo; was the reply of Adams;
&ldquo;they knowed of us afore we knowed anything of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did they allow us to pass their camp undisturbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things weren&rsquo;t in the right shape for &rsquo;em. There
are only three guns among &rsquo;em, though them kind of
Injins are as good with the bow as the rifle, and they
made up their minds that if we let them alone, they
wouldn&rsquo;t bother us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said awhile ago that we should have trouble
from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so we shall; when they reasoned like I was
sayin&rsquo;, they didn&rsquo;t know anything about the little accident
that happened to their chief; it&rsquo;s that which will
make things lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t see the point where that accident took
place,&rdquo; said Captain Dawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; the trail curves too much, but we can foller it
most of the way; they&rsquo;re likely to go right on without
&rsquo;specting anything, but when they find the horse, it&rsquo;ll
set &rsquo;em to looking round. After that, the band will begin
to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the party were watching the five Indians, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
leader was seen to pass from view around the curve in
the trail, followed by the next, until finally the fifth disappeared.
All this time, not one of the warriors looked
behind him. It was a singular line of action, and because
of its singularity roused the suspicion of the spectators.</p>
<p>While three of the miners resumed their seats on
the boulders and ground, Vose Adams kept his feet.
Doubling each palm, so as to make a funnel of it, he
held one to either eye and continued scrutinizing the
point where he had last seen the hostiles. He suspected
it was not the last of them. Instead of imitating him,
his friends studied his wrinkled countenance.</p>
<p>The air in that elevated region was wonderfully
clear, but it is hardly possible to believe the declaration
which the guide made some minutes later. He insisted
that, despite the great distance, one of the Indians, after
passing from view, returned over his own trail and
peeped around the bend in the rocks, and that the guide
saw his black hair and gleaming snake-like eyes. The
fact that Vose waited until the savage had withdrawn
from sight, before making the astonishing declaration,
threw some discredit on it, for it would have required
a good telescope to do what he claimed to have done
with the unassisted eye alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see I was looking for something of the kind,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
he explained, &ldquo;or mebbe I wouldn&rsquo;t have obsarved
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you tell the color of his eyes?&rdquo; asked the
doubting Ruggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were as black as coal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is safe to say that,&rdquo; remarked the parson, &ldquo;inasmuch
as I never met an Indian who had eyes of any
other color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are such,&rdquo; said Vose, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em,
though I&rsquo;ll own they&rsquo;re mighty scarce and I never
knowed of any in this part of the world. Howsumever,
I won&rsquo;t purtend that I could see the color of a
man&rsquo;s eyes that fur, but I did see his hair, forehead and
a part of his ugly face. He knowed we was behind him
all the time, and this one wanted to find out what we
was doing. When he larned that, they kept on along
the ledge, but there&rsquo;s no saying how fur they&rsquo;ll go afore
they find something&rsquo;s gone wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Dawson showed less interest in this by-play
than the others. He was not concerned with what was
behind them, so much as with what was in front. The
belief was so strong with him that their persistent travel
through the night had brought them close to the fugitives
that he begrudged the time necessary for the animals
to rest and eat.</p>
<p>Parson Brush felt that Adams was acting wisely in
giving attention to the rear. It would be the height of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
folly to disregard these formidable warriors when they
meant trouble. Brush rose to his feet and using his
palms as did the guide, scanned the country behind
them.</p>
<p>He saw nothing of any warrior peering around the
rocks, but he did see something, which escaped even
the keen vision of Vose Adams himself. Beyond the
ledge and a little to the left, he observed a riderless
horse, with head high in air, and gazing at something
which the two white men could not see. The parson
directed the attention of Vose to the animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gracious! it&rsquo;s the chief&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; he exclaimed;
&ldquo;do you see that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other two were now looking and all plainly saw
a warrior advance into view, approaching the animal,
which, instead of being frightened, seemed to recognize
his friends, and remained motionless until the Indian
came up and grasped the thong about his neck.
Then the two passed from sight.</p>
<p>The identical thing prophesied by Vose Adams had
occurred under the eyes of the four pursuers. The
steed of the dead chieftain had been recovered, and it
would not take the hostiles long to penetrate the mystery
of the matter. Vose was wise in taking the course
he did, and his companions were now inclined to believe
his astonishing assertion that he saw one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
number when he peeped around the curving ledge and
watched their actions.</p>
<p>However, it would have been absurd to wait where
they were in order to learn every move of their enemies,
for that would have been a voluntary abandonment
of the advantage secured at the cost of so much
labor and danger. Captain Dawson insisted that the
pursuit should be pressed without any thought of the
red men, and Vose consented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing we mustn&rsquo;t forget, captain,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and that is that it is daytime and not night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not catch your meaning,&rdquo; replied the captain,
pausing on the point of moving off to secure his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this: them people in front will keep as sharp
an eye to the rear as to the front; more&rsquo;n likely it will
be sharper, and it will be a bad thing if they discover
us when we&rsquo;re two or three miles off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall we prevent it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do it, if we&rsquo;re careful. You&rsquo;ll remember
that when you went over this route last, you come upon
places where you could see for a mile or more, &rsquo;cause
the trail was straight and broad, while there are others
where you can&rsquo;t see more&rsquo;n a hundred yards. Them
that I&rsquo;ve named last is where we must overhaul &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds well, Vose,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;but I
am unable to see how you are going to manage so as
to bring that about.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re getting the animals ready, I&rsquo;ll take a
look ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not in the nature of an explanation, but the
three willingly did their part. Vose disappeared almost
instantly, and, though they took but a few minutes to
prepare their animals for the resumption of travel, he
was back among them, the expression of his face showing
that he brought news of importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t fur off,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say anything more than that we&rsquo;re purty
close to &rsquo;em. Let&rsquo;s push on!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>STRANGERS</h3>
</div>
<p>The signs of an approaching storm that had been
noted with some apprehension the night before, passed
away. The sky revealed hardly a cloud rift, and, when
the sun had climbed the mountain crests, the scene was
grand beyond description. But for the grim errand of
the four men, holding relentlessly to the pursuit, they
must have yielded to its impressive influence.</p>
<p>The trail remained so favorable for a couple of miles
further, that it was passed at the same easy, swinging
gallop. Vose Adams retained his place a few paces
in advance of the others, who saw him glance sharply
to the right and left, often to the ground and occasionally
to the rear, as if to assure himself that none of his
friends was going astray.</p>
<p>The moderate but continuous descent of the path
took them so far downward that the change of temperature
again became noticeable. The ground was rough
and uneven and the animals dropped to a walk. Sometimes
the course led around boulders, through sparse
growths of cedar, beside brawling torrents, two of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
which they were compelled to ford, where it was hard
for their animals to keep their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last fall,&rdquo; remarked the guide, at the most difficult
of these passages, &ldquo;I had to wait two days before I
dared try to cross with Hercules and one of the other
mules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companions nodded their heads but made no
other answer. They were not in the mood for talking.</p>
<p>They were now making their way through a ca&ntilde;on
similar to Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch, with rents and yawning
ravines opening on the right and left, before which the
party might have halted in perplexity, had it been in
the night time. But the path showed plainly and the
familiarity of the guide prevented any mistake on his
part.</p>
<p>Adams had intimated that by a certain line of procedure
the watchful fugitives could be prevented from
discovering the approach of the pursuers until too late
to escape them. In counting upon his ability to do
this, he overestimated his skill, for the task was clearly
impossible, and it was because of his efforts in that direction
that he made a serious blunder. He had crossed
for the third time a stream which was shallow, and,
upon reaching the opposite bank, where the ground was
moist and soft, he reined up with an exclamation of impatience.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Captain Dawson, in
the same mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve passed &rsquo;em,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re somewhere
behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be found out, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
a great distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain angrily wheeled his horse and re-entered
the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t get away, it won&rsquo;t be our fault,&rdquo; was
his ungracious comment; &ldquo;we have done little else
than throw away our chances from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide made no response, and the next minute
the four were retracing their course, their animals at
a walk, and all scanning the rocks on either hand as
they passed them.</p>
<p>It was clear by this time that the fugitives held one
important advantage over their pursuers. The route that
they were following was so devious and so varied in its
nature, that only at rare intervals could it be traced
with the eye for a quarter or half a mile. Certain of
pursuit, Lieutenant Russell and his companion would
be constantly on the lookout for it. They were more
likely, therefore, to discover the horsemen than the latter
were to observe them. Even if their flight was interrupted,
there were innumerable places in this immense
solitude where they could conceal themselves for
an indefinite period.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>The question the pursuers asked themselves was
whether the others had strayed unwittingly from the
trail, or whether they had turned off to elude their pursuers,
whose desperate mood they could not but know.
The latter supposition seemed the more likely, since the
path was marked so plainly that it could be lost only by
unaccountable carelessness.</p>
<p>At the first break in the side of the vast mountain
walls Vose Adams again slipped from his mule and
spent several minutes in studying the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t gone in here,&rdquo; was his comment, as
he remounted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make certain that we are not too far back,&rdquo; said
the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made no mistake,&rdquo; was the curt reply of the
guide. The party had gone less than twenty rods further,
when another rent opened on the other side of the
ca&ntilde;on, which was about an eighth of a mile wide. It
would not do now to slight anything, and Adams
headed his mule diagonally across the gorge, the animal
walking slowly, while the rider leaned over with his
eyes on the ground. Suddenly he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve hit it this time! Here&rsquo;s where they went
in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All four leaped from the back of their animals.
Adams pointed out the faint indentations made by the
hoofs of two horses. Less accustomed than he to study
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
such evidence, they failed to note that which was plain to
him; the hoof prints of one of the animals were smaller
than those of the other, since they were made by Cap,
the pony belonging to Nellie Dawson. There could no
longer be any doubt that the pursuers were warm on
the trail of the fugitives.</p>
<p>Such being the fact, the interest of the men naturally
centered on the avenue through which the others had
made their way.</p>
<p>It was one of those fissures, sometimes seen among
enormous piles of rock, that suggest that some
terrific convulsion of nature, ages before, has
split the mountain in twain from top to bottom.
The latter was on a level with the main
ca&ntilde;on itself, the chasm at the beginning being ten
or twelve yards in width, but, occurring in a depression
of the mountain spur, its height was no more than
five or six hundred feet, whereas in other localities it
would have been nearly ten times as great. The base
was strewn with fragments of sandstone, some of the
pieces as large as boulders, which had probably been
brought down by the torrents that swept through the
ravine in spring or when a cloudburst descended upon
the upper portion.</p>
<p>Standing at the entrance, it was observed that the
gorge trended sharply to the left, so that the view was
shut off at a distance of fifty yards. It was noticeable,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
too, that the path taken by the fugitives sloped upward
at so abrupt an angle that it must have sorely tried the
horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; was the comment of Vose Adams,
when he returned from a brief exploration of the ravine;
&ldquo;they got off and led their animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea of the distance they went?&rdquo;
asked Captain Dawson, who was in a more gracious
mood, now that he appreciated the value of the services
of their guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ve rid in front of that opening a good many
times, but this is the first time I ever went into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is to be done?&rdquo; asked Parson Brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, foller &rsquo;em of course,&rdquo; Wade Ruggles took
upon himself to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; replied Adams, &ldquo;for it is likely to
upset everything; I&rsquo;ll leave Hercules with you and
sneak up the gorge far enough to find how the land lays.
I&rsquo;ll come back as soon as I can, but don&rsquo;t get impatient
if I&rsquo;m gone several hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brush and Ruggles showed their displeasure, for,
while admitting the skill of the guide, they could not
see adequate cause for the impending delay. They had
made so many slips that it seemed like inviting another.
It was clear that they were close upon the fugitives, and
the two believed the true policy was to press the pursuit
without relaxing their vigor. But Captain Dawson,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
the one who naturally would have been dissatisfied, was
silent, thereby making it apparent that Adams was carrying
out a plan previously agreed upon by the two.</p>
<p>Vose paid no heed to Ruggles and the parson, but
started up the ravine, quickly disappearing from view.
Believing a long wait inevitable, the three prepared to
pass the dismal interval as best they could. Here and
there scant patches of grass showed in the ca&ntilde;on, and
the animals were allowed to crop what they could of
the natural food. The men lounged upon the boulders
at hand, smoked their pipes and occasionally exchanged
a few words, but none was in the mood for talking and
they formed a grim, stolid group.</p>
<p>Hardly ten minutes had passed, when Ruggles, with
some evidence of excitement, exclaimed in a guarded
undertone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helloa! Something&rsquo;s up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He referred to the horses, who are often the most reliable
sentinels in the presence of insidious danger.
Two of them had stopped plucking the grass, and, with
their ears pricked, were staring up the ca&ntilde;on at some
object that had attracted their attention and that was
invisible to their owners in their present situation.</p>
<p>Convinced that something unusual had taken place,
Ruggles walked out into the ca&ntilde;on where he could gain
a more extended view. One sweeping glance was
enough, when he hurried back to his companions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thunderation! all Sacramento&rsquo;s broke loose and is
coming this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three passed out from the side of the gorge to
where they had a view of the strange procession. There
seemed to be about a dozen men, mounted on mules,
with as many more pack animals, coming from the west
in a straggling procession, talking loudly and apparently
in exuberant spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like their looks,&rdquo; said Brush; &ldquo;it is best to
get our property out of their way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The counsel was good and was followed without a
minute&rsquo;s delay. The four animals were rounded up
and turned into the ravine, up which Vose Adams had
disappeared. They gave no trouble, but, probably because
of the steepness of the slope, none of the four
went beyond sight. Had the three men been given
warning, they would have placed them out of reach, for
none knew better than they how attractive horses are
to men beyond the power of the law. But it was too
late now, and the little party put on a bold front.</p>
<p>As the strangers drew near, they were seen to be nine
in number and they formed a motley company. Their
pack mules were so cumbrously loaded as to suggest
country wagons piled with hay. The wonder was how
the tough little animals could carry such enormous burdens,
consisting of blankets, picks, shovels, guns, cooking
utensils, including even some articles of furniture.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>Our older readers will recall that for years after the
close of the war, tens of thousands of the blue army
overcoats were in use throughout the country. It
looked as if every man in the present company was
thus provided, including in many instances trousers of
the same material, though each person had discarded
the army cap for a soft slouch hat, similar to those worn
by the miners. All the garments were in a dilapidated
condition, proving their rough usage as well as their
poor quality. Many of the heavy boots disclosed naked
toes, while the mules had not known a curry comb for
weeks and perhaps months.</p>
<p>The faces of the men were anything but attractive.
Most of them were heavily bearded, with long, frowsy,
unkempt hair, dangling about the shoulders. Every
one displayed side arms, and there could be no mistake
in setting them down as a reckless lot, whom a peaceable
citizen would not care to meet anywhere.</p>
<p>The leader of this mongrel gang was a massive man,
who bestrode so small a mule that his feet were only a
few inches from the ground. There was little semblance
of discipline in the company, but a certain rude
deference to the fellow, who kept his place at the head,
and did the loudest talking, ornamented with plenty of
expletives, indicated his prominence among his fellows.</p>
<p>The mountain tramps had descried the three men
standing at the side of the ca&ntilde;on, watching them as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
they approached. They ceased their boisterous talking
and studied them as they drew near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, pards?&rdquo; called the leader, raising his two
fingers to his forehead and making a military salute,
to which our friends responded coolly, hoping the company
would keep on without stopping.</p>
<p>But they were disappointed. Colonel Briggs, as his
men called him, suddenly shouted &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; in a voice
that could have been heard a mile off, and pulled so
hard on his bridle rein that he drew the jaws of the
mule against his breast, while the rider lay back almost
on the haunches of his animal, who showed his contrariness
by walking round in a short circle before standing
still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way, pards?&rdquo; asked the leader, while his
followers, who with more or less effort succeeded in
checking their mules, curiously surveyed the three
miners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We intend to visit Sacramento,&rdquo; replied Captain
Dawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! that&rsquo;s where we come from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your way to the diggings I presume?&rdquo; continued
the captain courteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter; we&rsquo;re going to New Constantinople,
which is the name of a mining settlement
in Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch. Do you know anything of the
place?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We live there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce! Queer town, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what respect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like visitors; Red Tom and Missouri Mike,
two of the gang with me, stopped there a year or so ago
with the idee of staying; the best they could do was to
sleep there one night and git fired the next morning.
That went agin the grain,&rdquo; continued Colonel Briggs,
&ldquo;and the more the boys thought it over the madder
they got. When they told the rest of us, we made up
our minds that the trouble was the diggings had panned
out so rich in them parts that the folks meant to keep
&rsquo;em to themselves. I don&rsquo;t call that square, so we&rsquo;re
going down to divvy with &rsquo;em. Big scheme, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our three friends were astounded. The addition of
this gang to New Constantinople meant nothing less
than its moral ruin. It would bring a peril from the
first hour and doubtless precipitate a murderous conflict
with a doubtful issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are a peculiar people,&rdquo; said Captain Dawson,
repressing all evidence of his anger; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a mistake to
attribute their prejudice against immigrants to the richness
of the diggings, for though they have been worked
for years, they have not produced much. But they want
no strangers among them, and I know they will not
allow you and your friends to make your homes in their
settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>Colonel Briggs threw back his head, opened his enormous
mouth and broke into uproarious laughter, most
of his companions joining him to the extent of a broad
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, boys? Won&rsquo;t let us settle among
&rsquo;em, eh? And there are nine of us and we hain&rsquo;t had a
scrimmage since we left Sacramento, except with the
Injins, which don&rsquo;t count. Stranger, we&rsquo;re yearning to
hear your folks say we shan&rsquo;t jine &rsquo;em, &rsquo;cause if they try
to stop it, it&rsquo;ll make things lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not a pleasant recollection of our friends that,
since their departure from New Constantinople, the
force left behind would be hardly a match for this desperate
gang of marauders, who no doubt were as eager
for trouble as they professed to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not make a settlement of your own?&rdquo; was
the conciliating question of Parson Brush; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
plenty of room in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be too peaceable like; it don&rsquo;t suit us;
we&rsquo;re looking for trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll find it powerful quick,&rdquo; said Wade Ruggles,
&ldquo;if you try to shove that gang of yours into New
Constantinople.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s music in our ears; that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re hungry
for; we&rsquo;re ready to start an opposition hotel to the
Heavenly Bower, too; we&rsquo;ve got the stock to furnish
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Wade,&rdquo; said the parson, &ldquo;keep your temper; we
can&rsquo;t afford to quarrel with these men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t take much for me to shoot that chap off
his mule as he sets there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave matters to the captain; it looks as if we shall
have a fight, but it is best to keep cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The observant trio had noticed an additional cause
for uneasiness. More than one of the party were surveying
the three horses and mule with admiring eyes.
Some of them spoke to one another in low tones, and
there could be no doubt they looked with envy upon
the animals, which, tiring of their confinement in the
ravine, had come forth as if with the purpose of passing
under review, on their way to crop the grass from
which they had been driven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; called one of the men behind him, &ldquo;them
is likely animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had obsarved that fact myself; strangers, I&rsquo;ve
made up my mind to buy them critters; what&rsquo;s your
price?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not for sale,&rdquo; replied Captain Dawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need them for our own use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t do anything of the kind,&rdquo; said the captain,
speaking with the utmost coolness, but with that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
paling of the countenance and glitter of the eyes that
Colonel Briggs would have done well to heed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strikes me, stranger, you&rsquo;re rather peart in your
observations,&rdquo; said the leader with an odd chuckle;
&ldquo;we ain&rsquo;t used to having people speak to us in that
style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my custom to say what I mean; it saves misunderstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion, stranger, you&rsquo;d better say trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of no importance to me what your opinion is;
we need the horses and the mule for our own use and
we shall keep them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got one more than you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He belongs to a friend who is not far off and will
soon return; we can&rsquo;t spare one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we give you four of ours for the lot, that&rsquo;ll make
an even thing of it. Besides, we&rsquo;ll throw in something
to boot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give one of the horse&rsquo;s shoes for all the
trash you have piled on top of your animals; the stuff
isn&rsquo;t worth house room, but it is what I should expect
to see in the hands of a lot of tramps like you and yours;
I wouldn&rsquo;t trade our mule for the whole party which, to
judge by their looks, ought to be in jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brush and Ruggles were amazed to hear the captain
use such language, for it sounded as if he was trying
to provoke instead of avoid a fight. The truth was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
veteran was thoroughly enraged by the evident purpose
of the fellow before him. Although his voice was low
and deliberate, the captain&rsquo;s temper was at a white heat.
The point had been reached where a desperate struggle
seemed unavoidable, and he wished to precipitate the
crisis, inasmuch as it had to come.</p>
<p>Colonel Briggs did not laugh, but turning his head,
talked for a minute with the man nearest him, their
words so low that no one else heard them. Then the
leader turned back in a quick, decisive way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There don&rsquo;t seem much use in talking, stranger,
so &rsquo;spose we make a fight of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you prefer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gang hardly expected so firm a front. Some of
them muttered to one another. They were not a unit
on the question, though it was evident that the majority
preferred to fight.</p>
<p>The three men stood with their backs almost against
the mountain wall. Each had a Winchester and revolver
and all were expert in the use of the weapons. The
others were gathered in an irregular group around their
leader. They, too, were provided with all the weapons
they could use, not to mention the extra guns strapped
upon the pack mules. They outnumbered our friends
three to one.</p>
<p>Captain Dawson could use his rifle as well with his
single arm as formerly with two.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t fire before me,&rdquo; he said in an undertone
to Brush, standing next to him; &ldquo;when the shooting begins,
I&rsquo;ll drop him off his mule before he knows what&rsquo;s
coming. When I say the word, let fly as quick as lightning!
Likely enough they&rsquo;ll win, but we&rsquo;ll make them
pay high for their victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you notice that tall thin man at the rear?&rdquo; asked
Brush, in the same guarded voice; &ldquo;his eyes shine like
a rattlesnake&rsquo;s; he&rsquo;ll be <i>my</i> first target.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>FRIENDS</h3>
</div>
<p>Colonel Briggs was nonplussed for the moment.
He had failed to scare the men whom he meant to despoil
of their property and some of the mutterings behind
him showed that he lacked the unanimous support
of his followers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said, looking round in their faces;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve heerd what these strangers say to my mild requests.
Since they are too mean to trade, I leave it to
you to say whether we shall let up on &rsquo;em or make &rsquo;em
trade; which is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trade! trade!&rdquo; was the response, given with such
ardency that there seemed to be no dissent, though there
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hits me right; trade it shall be; the first one
of the strangers that kicks, fill him full of holes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the first man that lays a finger on my property,&rdquo;
said Captain Dawson, in the same deliberate
voice, &ldquo;will be shot down like a dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person whom Parson Brush had selected a few
minutes before for his first target and whom he was
watching closely, now did an extraordinary thing. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
individual was thin to emaciation. His beard was scant
and scraggly, and his large black eyes gleamed like
those of a wild animal. He had a very long body, and
sat so upright in his saddle, with his Winchester resting
across in front, that he towered head and
shoulders above his companions. From the first, he
fixed his penetrating eyes on Captain Dawson and
studied him closely. It was this persistent intensity of
gaze that attracted the notice of Brush, who set him
down as being even more malignant than the leader of
the disreputable party.</p>
<p>When a collision was impending, and must have
come the next second, the singular looking man,
grasping his revolver, raised his hand above his head
and called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His commanding voice and manner hushed every
one. From his place at the rear, he spurred his mule
straight toward the three men standing on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off!&rdquo; commanded the parson; &ldquo;if you come
any nearer I&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The extraordinary looking individual gave him no
heed, but forced his mule in front of Captain Dawson,
upon whom he kept his eyes riveted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire till I give the word,&rdquo; commanded the
captain, who had become suddenly interested in the tall,
slim man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>Halting his mule directly before Dawson, and with
no more than a couple of yards separating them, the
stranger craned his head forward until his chin was
almost between the long ears of his animal. He seemed
to be trying to look the officer through, while every
other man watched the curious proceeding.</p>
<p>Suddenly the fellow resumed his upright posture in
the saddle, his manner showing that he had solved the
problem that perplexed him. Through his thin, scattered
beard, he was seen to be smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maurice Dawson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Formerly captain of the Iowa &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; cavalry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me, captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer thus appealed to took a single step forward,
and looked searchingly in the face of the man that
had thus addressed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something familiar in your looks and
voice, but I am unable to place you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of Corporal Bob Parker of the
&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Missouri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you are he! I recognize you now! I am glad to
greet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And shoving his Winchester under the stump of his
arm, Captain Dawson extended his hand to his old comrade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
and shook it warmly, the two seeming to forget the
presence of every one else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something in your face struck me,&rdquo; said the corporal,
&ldquo;but I wasn&rsquo;t sure. The last time I saw you,
you had both arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I got rid of this one at the very close of the
war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things were pretty well mixed up around Petersburg;
I tried to get on your track, but failed; I knew
you meant to come to California, and when we drifted
here, I was hopeful of finding you, but I didn&rsquo;t think
it would be in this style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While speaking the corporal had retained the hand
of the captain, shaking it occasionally as he spoke. He
now gave it a final pressure and dropped it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, you and I went through some pretty tough
scrimmages and you were always dead true and game;
when we lost our colonel and major, you took command
and led the charge that day at Cold Harbor;
Grant or Sheridan couldn&rsquo;t have done better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> rather warm,&rdquo; smiled the captain, blushing
at the compliment; &ldquo;but, corporal, it looks as if we are
going to have something of the kind here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Parker deliberately turned to the wondering
group behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim and Tom, you know what we agreed on, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
this should prove to be my old commander. You two
wore the gray, but you are true blue now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this reminder, two of the company without a
word rode forward and placed themselves beside the
corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll face the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His suggestion was followed. The three wheeled
their animals around, so that their riders, like the footmen,
were in a line confronting Colonel Briggs and his
astonished company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dress,&rdquo; said the corporal, looking down and moving
his mule about until the alignment would have
drawn a compliment from a West Point cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, are your shooting irons ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They gin&rsquo;rally air,&rdquo; was the significant response
of one of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, colonel,&rdquo; added the corporal making a
military salute; &ldquo;everything being in readiness please
let the skirmish proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Briggs emitted a forceful exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of all this? I don&rsquo;t understand
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are six on each side; that evens matters;
shall you start the music or do you prefer to have the
captain fire the opening gun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me what this means.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It means that Captain Dawson and Corporal Bob
Parker have drunk from the same canteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be conceded that Colonel Briggs had one
merit; no one was quicker than he to grasp a situation.
So long as there were nine men on one side and three
on the other, the success of the former was promising.
He meant to crowd the defiant miners to the wall and
would have done so but for the unprecedented turn of
affairs. Now it was six to six and he knew the mettle
of the three recruits that had joined the miners. Bob
Parker was the most terrific fighter in the whole company.
He was one of those men, occasionally seen, who
was absolutely without fear. He would have stood up
alone and fought the other eight. During that single
week in Sacramento, he gained the name of a terror
and caused a sigh of relief on the part of the authorities
when he left for the mountains.</p>
<p>The corporal always fired to kill, and his skill with
rifle and pistol was marvelous. While talking with
Colonel Briggs, he fixed his brilliant black eyes on him,
as if to intimate that he had selected <i>him</i> for his pet
antagonist. All this was disconcerting.</p>
<p>In this crisis, when every nerve was drawn tense and
the question of life and death hung on the passing of a
breath, Colonel Briggs leaned backward and elevating
his chin in the way that had become familiar, emitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
one of his resounding laughs. Then he abruptly
snapped his jaws together like the springing of a trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Bob, this puts a different face on things,&rdquo; he
said cheerily; &ldquo;if the man&rsquo;s a friend of yours, of course
we can&rsquo;t quarrel with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think not,&rdquo; replied the corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the army myself,&rdquo; added the colonel, &ldquo;but
didn&rsquo;t stay long; me and General Grant couldn&rsquo;t agree
as to how the war should be run, and one night when
no one was around, I resigned and left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t win your title in the service,&rdquo; remarked
Captain Dawson, who felt that he could afford
to show good will, now that the situation had taken so
remarkable a turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarcely; the boys think that no officer lower than
a colonel is fit to command this crowd, so that&rsquo;s how
I got the handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Dawson could not forbear saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it much more befitting that a true and tried
soldier, like Corporal Parker, should be in your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was offered to me,&rdquo; said the corporal, &ldquo;but I
refused it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we agreed to make him a full-fledged major-general,
but he declined the honor with some sarcastic
remarks,&rdquo; said the colonel; &ldquo;howsumever, boys, now
that things have been straightened out, do you intend
to go with the captain or with us?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>Corporal Parker addressed his two comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheel and salute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They faced their animals around, and, taking the
cue from the corporal, made an elaborate military salutation
to Captain Dawson and his companions. Then
they wheeled again and rode back to their former places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my best regards,&rdquo; added the colonel, also saluting,
while the rest half-nodded and grinned over
the odd turn of affairs. Dawson, Brush and Ruggles
unbent sufficiently to respond, but kept their places, side
by side, and watched the curious procession until it
passed out of sight beyond a sweeping curve in the
ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we are likely to see any more of them,&rdquo;
said the parson; &ldquo;they are an ugly lot and badly want
our horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not badly enough to fight Corporal Parker and his
two friends. The corporal is the bravest man I ever
saw. I know he was disappointed when the colonel was
so quick in backing down. He will go hungry for two
or three days, for the sake of a fight. It is he and not
the colonel or any one in the company that is spoiling
for a row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I picked him out as the first one to shoot,&rdquo;
grimly remarked Brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chances are ten to one that he would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
dropped you first, but it shows how easily one may be
mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Ruggles earnestly, &ldquo;when that
gang strikes New Constantinople, there&rsquo;ll be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt of it,&rdquo; commented Brush; &ldquo;the
forces will be about equal; if the boys at home could
have warning of what is coming, they would make it
so hot for Colonel Briggs and his tramps that they
would be glad to camp somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t improve matters, for of necessity
there would be passing back and forth, and there are
some people at New Constantinople who would welcome
the change. That&rsquo;s the worst of it; a good deal
of this evil seed will fall on soil waiting for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be back in time to take a hand in the business,&rdquo;
said the parson; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether your
friend, the corporal, can be secured as an ally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is doubtful, for about the only merits he has are
his bravery and his loyalty to his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my &rsquo;pinion the same is considerable,&rdquo; commented
Ruggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be a powerful friend to Nellie, because
she is a female and because she is my daughter, but,&rdquo;
added the father with a sigh, &ldquo;I have my doubts
whether I shall ever take her to the settlement again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This announcement strangely affected the two who
heard it, for the dearest schemes which they secretly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
nourished included the spending of their days in the
mining settlement. The hope of each had flickered
into life once more with the prospect of recovering and
punishing her abductor. They knew that she would
bitterly mourn his loss, and would probably be inconsolable
for a time, but the months and years would
bring forgetfulness and then&ndash;&ndash;who should say what
<i>might</i> come to pass?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought,&rdquo; remarked Ruggles, as they resumed
their seats, &ldquo;that we should have a weary wait for
Vose, but it didn&rsquo;t prove so dull after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been gone more than an hour, and there&rsquo;s
no saying when he will be back. He has his own way
of managing this business, and, though I concede his
skill and superior knowledge in this part of the world,
it is hard to keep my patience when I see the hours
slipping away without bringing any results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the patience of the three men was tried more
sorely than ever before, and to a greater extent than
any one of them anticipated. Noon came and passed
and without bringing Vose Adams. The party partook
sparingly of their lunch, leaving enough for their absent
friend, but the lagging hours wore away and they
still waited. They said little to one another, but the
captain, unable to restrain his restlessness, wandered
down the ca&ntilde;on. The two left behind watched him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
until he passed from view in the direction taken by
Colonel Briggs and his company. A few minutes later,
the report of his rifle came back to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if <i>he&rsquo;s</i> got into trouble,&rdquo; exclaimed the
parson, rising to his feet and peering to their left, without
seeing everything to explain the sound that had
reached them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; replied Ruggles; &ldquo;everything
is going wrong; Vose wouldn&rsquo;t stay away so
long, unless he, too, was in difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain may need us; he can&rsquo;t be far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gun in hand, the couple walked hurriedly down the
ca&ntilde;on, on the alert for Indians, for it seemed more
likely that if any danger threatened, it was from them.
To their relief, however, they soon found their alarm
groundless. The captain was seen coming, apparently
as well as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is wrong,&rdquo; he explained when they were
within speaking distance; &ldquo;I saw an antelope among
the rocks and took a shot at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How near did you come to hitting him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made only a single jump after he received my
bullet; it&rsquo;s a pity he didn&rsquo;t make a couple of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have brought him over the outer rock and
into the ravine; then we should have had something
for supper. Haven&rsquo;t you seen Adams yet?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>Instead of answering directly the three looked toward
the fissure in the side of the ca&ntilde;on, and there, to
their unspeakable relief, they saw the man who had
been absent for so many hours. As is the rule at such
times, their ill-humor deepened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you wait till morning?&rdquo; was the question
of the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid I would have to do so,&rdquo; replied the
guide, whose flushed face and agitated manner proved
that he brought important news; &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t have to,
and got away in time to reach you afore night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much before,&rdquo; commented the parson; &ldquo;you
must have had a remarkable experience to detain you so
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather, but I&rsquo;m starving, give me something to eat,
while I talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lunch was produced, and he fell to with avidity,
but he saw they were in no mood for frivolity, and he
did not presume upon their indulgence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, pards, after leaving you, I picked my way
as best I could up the gorge, which runs back, with the
bottom rising more or less all the way, for &rsquo;bout two
hundred yards when you reach level ground. That is
to say, the gorge ends, but the ground is anything but
level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they went all that distance ahead of you with
their animals?&rdquo; asked Brush.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they done; the tracks of the horses
were so plain there couldn&rsquo;t be any mistake &rsquo;bout it.
At the top of the gorge, the trail slanted off to the right,
toward a big pile of rocks, caves and gullies, where it
didn&rsquo;t look as if a goat could travel. There was so
much stone that it was mighty hard to keep on the trail
and I lost it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t you find it again?&rdquo; demanded the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it took a good deal of time; that&rsquo;s one
reason why I was gone so long, but it wasn&rsquo;t the only
reason by a jug full. When I struck it agin, it led
straight toward a high rocky place to the left, where
I made up my mind the two were hidin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would imply that they knew we were close
behind them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be any doubt of that. What bothered
me was to learn what they had done with their horses,
fur the prints that I followed was made by the folks&rsquo;
feet. I couldn&rsquo;t figger out what they had done with
the animals, and I spent some more time in trying to
larn, but it was no use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bime by I struck better ground, where the trail
was so clear I could have trotted over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo; asked Ruggles.</p>
<p>Adams shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have done; as I said they must have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
found out, purty early in the day, that we was after
them, for if they didn&rsquo;t, why did they turn off the
reg&rsquo;lar track?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind asking questions,&rdquo; replied the captain;
&ldquo;go on with your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, pards, by that time I must have been a mile
from here and it looked as if I&rsquo;d have to go that much
further. I had a good mind to come back after you,
for time was important, but when another rocky,
walled-up place showed in front of me, I was sartin I
was close upon &rsquo;em. Their horses couldn&rsquo;t make their
way through such a spot, and I was sure I had &rsquo;em
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come back at once?&rdquo; said the captain,
&ldquo;but, never mind, go on with your account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would be best to find out just how
they was fixed. At the same time, it would never do to
let &rsquo;em diskiver that I was about. So I was powerful
careful and crept forward as if into an Injin camp. It
wasn&rsquo;t long before I smelled burning wood. That told
me they had come to a stop, built a fire and didn&rsquo;t
dream I was anywhere in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wasn&rsquo;t through with the bother yet; it took
me another long time to find where that fire was burnin&rsquo;,
but I hit it at last. A little faint streak of smoke
was climbin&rsquo; from behind a ridge, among a growth of
pines. I begun creeping forward when I changed my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
mind. I thought that if one of &rsquo;em happened to be on
the watch and see me, they would be off afore I could
git anywhere near &rsquo;em. So I worked round to the
other side to come upon &rsquo;em from that. Then you see
if they took the alarm, they&rsquo;d have to come back toward
you or make another long circuit. Anyway, I was
sure of a chance to meet &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, pards, I don&rsquo;t want to make a long story of
what is a short one. I got round to tother side, but it
took me a good while, and it&rsquo;s hardly an hour ago that
I catched my first sight of their camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What passed between you and them?&rdquo; asked the
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I rested my eyes on the little bundle of wood
burnin&rsquo;, there wasn&rsquo;t a man, woman or horse in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The listeners were dumbfounded for the moment.
After the waste of the greater part of the day, they
were no nearer seeing the fugitives than before. In a
voice, husky with passion, Captain Dawson exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take hard work to convince me that all this
was not done on purpose by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Vose, showing
more anger than at any time since the strange hunt had
been begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had spent a week trying to fix things so as
to help them get away from us, you couldn&rsquo;t have done
any better than your own account shows you to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
done. The whole day has been lost and we stand just
as near success as we did twenty-four hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have returned to us as soon as you
located them,&rdquo; added Brush in the effort to soothe the
ruffled feelings of the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps I didn&rsquo;t do the wisest thing,&rdquo; replied Adams
with unexpected meekness; &ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t the first person
in the world that has made a mistake. Howsumever,
there won&rsquo;t be any more slips by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companions looked inquiringly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that remark,&rdquo; said the captain,
&ldquo;when you are sure to blunder as long as you attempt
to manage things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the p&rsquo;int; I resign from this time forward;
I haven&rsquo;t given satisfaction and you may now do the
work to suit yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as well,&rdquo; commented the captain, &ldquo;for we
can&rsquo;t make a greater mess of it than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story told by Vose Adams was a singular one,
but the most singular feature about it was that it did
not contain a grain of truth. Every statement was a
falsehood, deliberately intended to deceive, and, seeing
that he had succeeded in his purpose, he was satisfied.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>VOSE ADAMS</h3>
</div>
<p>Lieutenant Russell gave no hint to Nellie Dawson
of the scheme upon which he had fixed his hopes,
until after she had confessed her love for him, and he
was certain beyond the shadow of a doubt, that he possessed
the sole affection of her heart. Even then he
hesitated for he knew the shock it would cause the gentle
one, who was devotedly attached to her father. But
the resolution of Captain Dawson to spend the remainder
of his days at the mining settlement, and his intention
of selecting her husband from among those that
had made New Constantinople their home for years,
crystallized the determination that had been vaguely
shaping itself in his brain for weeks.</p>
<p>As he expected, she recoiled shocked by the proposal
to leave her father; but love is eloquent, and he won
by convincing her that the separation would be only
temporary. Her father would be quick to see the great
wrong his course would inflict upon his child, and he
would not only consent to the union, but would follow
and make his home with them. It was this implicit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
belief which made her the companion of Lieutenant
Russell in the flight from the mountain settlement.</p>
<p>The project having been carefully planned and arranged,
the preparations were more complete than those
of their pursuers. They took sufficient extra clothing
in the form of wraps and blankets, and enough food
to last for several days. They were well mounted and
had the companionship of the huge dog Timon, with
his almost human intelligence.</p>
<p>The lieutenant&rsquo;s memory of places was good, and,
having a number of hours of daylight at command, he
escaped the mistake of his pursuers. The turn from
Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch was made at the right point, and
they were miles on their way before their flight was
discovered by Captain Dawson and his friends.</p>
<p>Both of the fugitives did not doubt they would be
pursued. They knew the consuming anger that would
take possession of her father, who would probably collect
several companions and start after them with furious
haste. He would take frightful vengeance upon
the man that had dared to steal his daughter. Everything,
therefore, must be done to keep beyond his reach
until his wrath had time to cool. The intention was to
make Sacramento ahead of him. At that city, the lieutenant
would seek out his future father-in-law and
plead his cause.</p>
<p>When night closed around them, they had penetrated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
to a distance of perhaps fifteen miles in the Sierras. It
was at sunset that they passed a spot, where horses and
riders, the latter on foot, had to pick their way with
extreme care, while even Timon, who clung faithfully
to them, showed timidity, though he had been over the
place before. The sagacious brute knew that a mis-step
on his part meant death. The passage, however, was
made without mishap, and Russell, as he helped his
companion into the saddle, assured her that nothing
so trying to the nerves was to be expected during the
rest of the journey.</p>
<p>There was no fear of pursuit until after nightfall, but
Russell frequently pointed his glass backward and
scanned the trail over his whole field of vision. When
the gathering darkness shut out everything, he had
seen nothing of enemies, either white or red. He could
not forget that on his previous journey, he and the captain
had desperate fighting with the Indians and the
same peril still impended.</p>
<p>Nellie was eager to cover all the ground possible,
while the opportunity was theirs, and the flight was
pushed longer than Russell would have advised. Finally,
he insisted they should stop and rest themselves
and horses for the remainder of the night. The halting
place was selected with much care. The animals were
turned loose, where the grass was growing and a small
stream wound its way toward a larger one. Then the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
two, accompanied by Timon, pushed in among the
rocks to where the final halt was made.</p>
<p>They were in profound darkness. The lieutenant
decided to start a fire, and, with much difficulty, gathered
a sufficiency of dried branches. They were fortunate
enough to find a partial cavern, so open in front
that it would have given slight shelter in the event of a
storm. When the blaze threw out its cheerful light, it
served to dissipate the gloom which in spite of themselves
had oppressed them with the coming of night.</p>
<p>They partook of food and the lieutenant&rsquo;s spirits
rose, for he saw nothing to prevent the full success of
the dream which had inspired and thrilled him so long.
His buoyancy was infectious, and he brought a smile to
the beauteous countenance by his merry sallies, and his
picture of the happy future that was close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father will be angry at first,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it
would be strange if he were not, but he loves you and
I think has a pretty fair opinion of me. When he gains
time to think over the matter, he will admit the wisdom
of what we have done and we shall receive his blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was this assurance, more than all else, that served
to lift the gloom from her. Deep as was her love for
the one at her side, it would not have sufficed to draw
her from her adored parent, had she believed that his
resentment against her would last. As it was, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
grieved that even for a brief time, as she thought would
be the case, he should hold harsh feelings toward her.</p>
<p>No chivalrous knight of the Crusades could have
been more scrupulously considerate of lady intrusted
to his charge than Lieutenant Russell. He would have
died before offending Nellie Dawson by act, word or
presumptuous thought. When, as the night advanced,
the bright eyes began to grow drowsy, he arranged a
couch for her, saw that she was well provided with
blankets and then turned to the immense dog, who had
never left them and who looked as if he understood
everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Timon, you are to stay right here,&rdquo; he said,
bending over and impressively shaking his finger at the
animal; &ldquo;you are not to venture a dozen feet from your
mistress without permission. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A whine and wagging of the tail left no doubt that
the wishes of his late master were clear to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your gun at your side,&rdquo; he added, turning
to Nellie; &ldquo;I do not think you will have any call to use
it. We have not met any Indians and your father cannot
overtake us before morning. Timon will be sure to
give you warning of the approach of danger, and, if
your gun goes off, I shall be here in a twinkling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bade her good night and departed. Enough wood
had been flung on the fire to keep it going for an hour
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
or two, but long before it sank to ashes, the girl had
drifted into dreamland.</p>
<p>The lieutenant carefully selected his own sleeping
quarters. He finally fixed upon a large flat boulder, at
the rear of the cavern occupied by Timon and his
charge; but, although beyond sight, he was near enough
to reach the spot on the instant needed. Spreading out
his blanket, he lay down upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This recalls the old days in Virginia, when mud a
foot deep, with the rain dashing in our faces, was what
we had for weeks at a time. This couch doesn&rsquo;t equal
a feather bed, but it will answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night passed without incident and it was hardly
light when the young officer was astir. He visited the
horses and found them cropping the grass, but he
waited until Timon came to him before calling upon
Nellie. She, too, had been awake for some time and
they partook of their morning meal with rugged appetites.</p>
<p>She was so eager to hurry on that he lost no time
in taking the road again. Neither could doubt that
their pursuers were on their trail, and, with the aid of
his small glass, he carefully studied the country behind
them. It was not long before he made the discovery he
dreaded: four horsemen were following their footprints,
and beyond them were the five Indians picking
their way along the ledge in the opposite direction.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>The lieutenant passed the glass to his companion
who scrutinized the party with the keenest interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have traveled all night,&rdquo; remarked her
escort, while she still peered through the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows how dreadfully angry father is; I hope
it will not last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make out the members of the party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She studied them a minute or two more before answering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that is father who is close to the man on a
mule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one on a mule must be Vose Adams, for he is
more accustomed to that sort of animal. I am sorry
he is with the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Nellie, lowering the glass and looking
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is so familiar with the trail, that it will be hard
work to outwit him; he isn&rsquo;t the man to make mistakes.
Did you recognize the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot be sure, but I suspect they are Mr. Ruggles
and Mr. Brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt you are right,&ndash;&ndash;not because I was
able to identify them, but because the two are partners
and your father would naturally go to them first. I
do not think any one of the four has a glass, so, despite
their sharp eyes, we have a big advantage in that respect.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But they know the route better than we, and we are
losing time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The course of the trail took them out of the field of
vision of their pursuers. It was at the suggestion of
Russell that the two turned aside from the ca&ntilde;on into
the fissure-like gorge. This would have been a serious
mistake, except for the plan he had in view, for it must
place the pursuers in advance, the very thing which it
would seem the fugitives ought if possible to prevent.</p>
<p>The lieutenant had believed from the first that Vose
Adams, in threading his way through the mountains,
traveled a good many miles more than was necessary.
It was quite likely that, if he could follow a straight
line, he would shorten the distance one-half. Although
this was impossible, the young man, nevertheless, was
convinced that by changing the route, a good many
miles could be saved: and it was in his mind to do that
thing.</p>
<p>The lieutenant&rsquo;s experience in campaigning had
taught him the danger of going astray, when picking his
way through an unfamiliar country, but the little compass
attached as a charm to his watch chain would help
him to keep track of the variations and windings, and
he was confident of coming out right. He and Nellie
were well mounted and armed, all of which being impressed
upon his companion, she offered no objection
to the radical change of plan which took them out of
the ca&ntilde;on into the ravine that led them they knew not
whither, but it was ominous of disaster that at the top
of the fissure, when the two were leading their animals,
a grievous mishap occurred. The pony of Nellie
slipped and sprained his ankle so badly that he whined
with pain and paused with his weight supported on
three legs.</p>

THE LIEUTENANT PASSED THE GLASS TO HIS COMPANION, WHO SCRUTINIZED THE PARTY WITH THE KEENEST INTEREST.&ndash;&ndash;PAGE 269.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bad go!&rdquo; exclaimed the dismayed Russell;
&ldquo;it will be several days before he is able to travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She examined the ankle, as best she could, trying to
soothe the pain by passing her hand over the injured
part, but it was plain that neither she nor her companion
could give any help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; she said sympathetically; &ldquo;you cannot
go any further; what shall be done, Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one thing seems possible,&ndash;&ndash;take you on my
horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will become of Cap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must leave him behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will happen to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one will pick him up, or, after his leg recovers,
he may find his way back to the settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impulsive girl flung her arms about the animal&rsquo;s
neck and touched her lips to the silken nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall not part us, Cap,&rdquo; she exclaimed with
tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>The lieutenant watched this by-play, full of sympathy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
for the girl, but he was in a quandary. Prudence
seemed to demand that everything should be sacrificed
to speed by abandoning the pony. In all probability,
the latter would serve as a dinner for some of the
bears, wolves or other denizens of the mountains, who
would quickly harry him to death. To wait where they
were until the animal was able to travel rendered certain
a speedy meeting with their pursuers. The woodcraft
of Vose Adams would enable him to discover
with slight delay the point where the fugitives had left
the ca&ntilde;on, and he would guide his companions with the
skill of one of the mountain Indians themselves.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the plan he had in view imposed
prodigious work upon his own animal. Between the
halting place and Sacramento were many miles of easy
traveling, over which he could walk, but for long distances
the beast would be compelled to carry double.
In the event of close pursuit, this must prove a fatal
handicap.</p>
<p>In his perplexity, the lieutenant again examined the
hurt of the pony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be cruel to make him take a single step,
but he may soon recover. I am afraid to leave him behind
and to continue our flight with only my horse.
You know how dangerous it is to linger, Nellie, when
it is certain <i>they</i> are not far off&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught his arm and whispered:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Look at Timon! he has discovered something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog was standing a few paces in front of them,
with his nose pointed toward the ca&ntilde;on. He emitted
several growls and pricked up his ears in a way that
left no doubt that he was angered. The lieutenant had
hardly time to place himself in an attitude of defence
with his Winchester, when a soft footfall was heard,
and the next moment Vose Adams emerged from behind
the pile of rocks and approached them.</p>
<p>It was proof of the guide&rsquo;s woodcraft that he was
able to come thus close before being detected by Timon,
who advanced threateningly toward him. A word,
however, from the lieutenant stayed the dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Vose,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;this is unexpected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I jedge and I&rsquo;ve a &rsquo;spicion that you ain&rsquo;t tickled
half to death to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were always friends, but I can&rsquo;t say that either
Nellie or I am glad to meet you under the circumstances;
for in truth, we have been doing all we could
to prevent such a meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things has that look,&rdquo; added Vose, standing on
guard as may be said, for he was not free from misgiving
concerning the young lieutenant whom he had
managed to run down. His positive orders forbade
him to assume the aggressive, but no one could forbid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
him to defend himself, and he did not mean that this
handsome officer should catch him unprepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom have you with you?&rdquo; asked Russell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain, Wade Ruggles and the parson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we suspected; I presume no one of the three
feels specially affectionate toward me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all the captain can do to prevent the other two
from quarrelin&rsquo; as to which shall have the first chance
to shoot you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does Captain Dawson prevent them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause he means to have the first chance himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about <i>you</i>?&rdquo; grimly asked Lieutenant Russell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A low down trick was played onto me; as near as
I can find out, the captain comes first, Wade and the
parson next and me fourth. You can see for yourself
that there won&rsquo;t be any chance at all left for me after
them three is through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look so,&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s a fact. But where are
the three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Along the main trail, down in the kenyon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did they not come with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I advised &rsquo;em to wait till I found out how the land
laid and they won&rsquo;t leave the spot till I get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Russell gave no expression to the thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
that flashed upon him. Why not keep Vose Adams a
prisoner? The loss of his services to the party would
be irreparable, for, as it was, the present hiding place
of the fugitives never would have become known to
them without the help of the guide. It was a daring
scheme, but there were so many objections to carrying
it out, that the officer dismissed it. In truth he thought
of a much better plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have told me enough, Vose, to prove that the
four men&ndash;&ndash;for I may as well include yourself&ndash;&ndash;feel
bitterer toward me than I suspected: do you think this
enmity of theirs will last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll let up as soon as you&rsquo;re shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Russell could not restrain a smile at this
way of putting it, while Nellie was so horrified that she
gasped and stared and listened in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be little doubt that you are right, but I
meant to ask whether you do not think the captain will
moderate his anger when he is given time to think it
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has had all night to do that, and this mornin&rsquo;
he was hotter if anything, than at any time since he
larned what you had done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did he learn it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, Vose told the facts which have already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
been made known to the reader, the most interesting
feature of which was that Adams was not an original
member of the pursuing party. But, although the
guide was so pronounced in his opinion of the continuance
of the enmity of Captain Dawson, the lieutenant
believed otherwise. He was confident that if he and
Nellie could reach Sacramento before meeting the irate
father, the latter would be open to reason, and all would
turn out well.</p>
<p>Vose turned to the young woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nellie, do you want a little advice from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to have it at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howsumever, what I say is as much for the leftenant
as for you, which the same is that both of you
should give up this bus&rsquo;ness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Nellie, &ldquo;you have just told us that
father is so angry with Lieutenant Russell that he will
shoot him the moment they meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can fix that easy &rsquo;nough; let the leftenant stay
here while you go with me; I think we can explain
matters to the captain and the others so they won&rsquo;t
bother the leftenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what am <i>I</i> to do?&rdquo; asked Russell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push on to Sacramento as fast as you can, for
though I think I can fix it, I wouldn&rsquo;t advise you to
take too many chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, after Nellie and I have fled from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
the settlement and got this far on the road to safety,
you urge me to give her up forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, that&rsquo;s lookin&rsquo; a little further ahead than I
meant to, but I &rsquo;spose it amounts to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean well, Vose, but do you imagine that
Nellie and I did not count the cost before turning our
backs on New Constantinople? Don&rsquo;t you suppose we
knew we should be pursued and were prepared for the
consequences?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say as to that, but it strikes me that the plan
I laid before you is the only one there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot get away from the captain and the men
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is no call for me to repeat my opinion,
but I will say that the decision shall rest with Nellie
herself. If she wishes to go with you I will interpose
not a word of objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked toward her as an invitation for her to
speak. There was a world of affection and faith in the
lustrous eyes, as she walked resolutely forward and
placed herself by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only death shall separate us!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>AN UNEXPECTED ALLY</h3>
</div>
<p>The lovelight shone in the eyes of Lieutenant Russell,
as he looked down at the slight figure beside him.
He tenderly passed his arm around the girl and touched
his lips to her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not that I doubted you, Nellie,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but that Vose might know the full truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning to the guide, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still advise her to leave me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vose Adams was unaccustomed to scenes like this.
He moved about uneasily, coughed, cleared his throat,
and for a few minutes was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to advise,&rdquo; he finally said; &ldquo;but
don&rsquo;t you think, if she could go to the captain and let
him see how she feels, he will give in? How would it
do for both of you to walk back with your arms round
each other&rsquo;s neck and sayin&rsquo; sweet words&ndash;&ndash;wouldn&rsquo;t
that fetch him? Hanged, if I know what to tell you!&rdquo;
he exclaimed desperately, observing the smiles on their
faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid your plan wouldn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; said the
lieutenant, &ldquo;but you have proved yourself the very
friend we need.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>These words were a hint of the scheme that had come
into the brain of the young officer. Had he made a
prisoner of Vose Adams, as he thought for a minute
of doing, the guide would really be more dangerous,
since there was no way of guarding against his treachery,
but if he could be turned into a friend, it would be
almost equivalent to saving the fugitives. It was that
for which the young man planned, but he felt that the
real work must be done by Nellie. He could not win
the good will of Vose, but she could, for who was able
to resist her appeals?</p>
<p>It was a proof of the brightness of the girl that she
caught the purpose of her escort the moment his last
words were uttered, and she performed her part with a
cleverness that could not have been surpassed.</p>
<p>Tears were in the eyes of the emotional Nellie, but
she stepped across the brief intervening space and laid
her hand on the arm of Adams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How glad I am, Vose, that you will help us, for
you have told enough to show that it will not do for us
to meet father for some time to come; we are now in
your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blamed if I won&rsquo;t do anything I can! But what
can <i>I</i> do? &rsquo;Spose I sneak back, shoot the captain and
then plug Ruggles and the parson? Will that suit
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious; I should rather you would kill me than
harm a hair of father&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, &rsquo;spose I shoot you and the leftenant and the
captain and the rest? No; that won&rsquo;t do; how the mischief
shall I fix things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cooler headed Russell saw that the problem had
been solved; Nellie Dawson had won over Vose Adams,
as may be said, by the turn of her finger. He was eager
to do all he could to help them, but in the flurry of the
moment could not reason with his usual acumen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any shooting, Vose; I am sure that
if we can reach Sacramento without meeting the captain,
his anger will pass away. In Sacramento, I shall
be able to arrange a meeting between him and his
daughter, and his love for her will break down the barriers
and do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in too deep water when you get to figgerin&rsquo;
that way, but there seems to be reason in what you say,
but what about Ruggles and the parson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave them out; they are in this as the friends
of Captain Dawson, and will not dare go contrary to
his wishes, but if they do, it can make no difference to
my plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just as savage as the captain,&rdquo; said Vose
significantly; &ldquo;and it won&rsquo;t do to forget &rsquo;em; but what
did you expect to do, when you left the kenyon? If
you come back, you would have been sartin to meet us,
and what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My intention was not to return, but to keep away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
from the main trail and hunt a shorter road through
the mountains to Sacramento.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vose Adams gave a low whistle of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst I ever heard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not follerin&rsquo; any trail at all; you would be
sartin to get lost and would never find your way
through the mountains; anyhow it would take you three
or four years, which I ca&rsquo;clate is longer than you want
to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you be so positive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true I never went to Sacramento and back, except
by follerin&rsquo; for most of the way the trail that I know
so well, but other folks as smart as you have been lost
in the mountains and you couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You advise against it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sure of your goin&rsquo; wrong that I won&rsquo;t try
to help you unless you give up the idee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I hereby give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Vose Adams had committed himself to Russell
and Nellie&rsquo;s interests, there was no more talking
at cross purposes. The object of the three was the
same, and they sat down on the rocks for consultation.
There was abundance of time in which to do this, since
those whom they feared would not leave the ca&ntilde;on until
the return of their guide, and he did not mean to go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
back until the day was so far spent that further delay
was unavoidable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be mad when they see me,&rdquo; he said with
a grin, &ldquo;but it won&rsquo;t do them any good and I&rsquo;ll fix up
a yarn about gettin&rsquo; on and then off your trail agin,
that they&rsquo;ll have to be satisfied with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will serve for to-night, but you will all be
astir at an early hour to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will still have to depend on me to guide &rsquo;em,
and I rather think I can steer &rsquo;em off the track, so as
to give you plenty of time to get out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as they leave the kenyon, that is as soon
as the way is clear, you must ride back to it and put
on all steam for Sacramento, for I understand, leftenant,
that you&rsquo;ve give up your idee of finding a new
route through the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got two good animals and you&rsquo;ll gain a full
day&rsquo;s start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget about poor Cap,&rdquo; said Nellie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did! if he can&rsquo;t go with you, you&rsquo;ll have to
leave him behind and ride double, but it will be rather
tough on your horse, leftenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nellie doesn&rsquo;t weigh enough to make any difference,
and I expect to walk most of the distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An unexpected piece of good fortune raised the spirits
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
of the three. To the amazement of all, Cap, the
pony, was seen hunting for grass and bearing upon the
lame foot with little inconvenience. That which was
thought to be a bad sprain was only a wrench, from
which he promised speedily to recover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be as well as ever by to-morrow mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
said Vose Adams; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll need to humor him at first,
but not for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As has been intimated, the guide remained with them
through most of the afternoon, for, if he had gone back
to his friends earlier than he did, he would not have
dared to offer any excuse for not leading them in the
pursuit, and he meant to avert all possibility of that.
The reader understands by this time why the guide formulated
such an astounding fiction when attempting
to explain the cause of his delay. Had his listeners
been in cooler mood, they might have tangled him up
with a few questions, but their exasperation and disgust
prevented.</p>
<p>Before parting with the fugitives, Vose assured them
that he was confident their plans could not fail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All they&rsquo;ve got to do,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;is to do nothing
afore to-morrow and then when the road is open,
strike out over the main trail as hard as they can travel.
I hope none of them Injins that we had the row with
will be pokin&rsquo; &rsquo;round to-night, for if there&rsquo;s to be any
trouble, it&rsquo;ll come from them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>It will be recalled that the story of Adams was received
with such coolness that he indignantly resigned
and told the captain to run matters himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll make purty work of it,&rdquo; chortled Vose
&ldquo;he won&rsquo;t be able to come within miles of where they
are hidin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the moody silence had lasted for some time,
the guide was moved to remark in a more conciliatory
spirit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing that mustn&rsquo;t be forgot: Colonel
Briggs and his folks won&rsquo;t make any trouble, but we&rsquo;re
not done with them Injins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there likelihood that Colonel Briggs will divert
them?&rdquo; asked the parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; for the redskins can&rsquo;t be fooled; they&rsquo;ll know
it wasn&rsquo;t any of the colonel&rsquo;s folks that give their chief
his walkin&rsquo; papers, but us, and they&rsquo;re the sort of people
that don&rsquo;t forget a thing of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of hunting up enough wood to
start a fire,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;but we don&rsquo;t need it,
and I suppose it will be safer without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; observed Ruggles, &ldquo;that what
we&rsquo;ve got the most to fear is that the Injins will run off
with our animals: we would be left in a bad fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must look out for that; I&rsquo;ll stand guard the
first part of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each was ready to take his turn, and it was arranged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
that Captain Dawson should act as sentinel until midnight,
when he would awake Vose Adams, who would
assume the duty till morning. Soon afterward, the
three wrapped themselves in their blankets and
stretched out on the ground, near the boulders, where
they speedily sank into deep slumber.</p>
<p>It seemed to Adams that he had slept less than an
hour, when the captain touched him. Rising immediately
to a sitting position, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it midnight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a half hour past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you awake me afore? Have you seen
anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure; my doubt made me hold on a little
longer, but I learned nothing of account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only that the animals appear to be uneasy, but
it may mean nothing, or it may mean a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n likely it means something. Where are
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lying down off there to the right, almost near
enough to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be too close; wal, you can sleep and I&rsquo;ll
take my turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus warned by Captain Dawson, Vose Adams assumed
the duties of sentinel with his senses on the
alert. He had become so accustomed to the delicate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
duty, when aware that the slightest slip on his part
meant death, that he was better fitted for the task than
any member of the party, though the experience of
Ruggles and the captain in the army had given them
the ability to awake at any moment fixed upon before
sinking into slumber, and they were sensitive to the
least disturbance while enjoying refreshing rest.</p>
<p>Adams believed what he had remarked more than
once that the little company of mountain Indians would
do their utmost to revenge themselves upon the men
who had taken off their chief. He suspected that
the five were prowling in the neighborhood, looking
for some such opportunity, and that they would strike
a blow before the rising of the morrow&rsquo;s sun.</p>
<p>Nothing was to be hoped for in the way of a diversion,
created by the intrusion of Colonel Briggs and
his vagrant miners. Not that the Indians were not
eager to strike at any members of the hated race, but
the all-controlling motive was lacking in the case of
the larger party.</p>
<p>Although the moon was in the sky, only a small part
of its light penetrated the ca&ntilde;on. Peering into the
darkness, Vose dimly made out the forms of the four
animals, who, having ceased their cropping of the grass,
had lain down for the remainder of the night. They
were so near that they could not be stampeded or stolen
without the effort being known to the sentinel.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>It would have been the height of rashness to start a
camp fire, for all the figures within its circle of illumination
must have formed the best of targets for their
stealthy foes. As it was, an enemy would have to steal
from the gloom and approach near enough to touch
them, before striking a blow or firing a shot.</p>
<p>Vose Adams, with his Winchester in his right hand
and held close to his side, took his seat on the ground,
resting his back against the nearest boulder. As a rule,
a sentinel can keep awake for an extended time only
by motion and exercise, such as walking to and fro,
but the trained hunter often takes the risk and there
is little danger of his succumbing, especially after he
has just finished a nap, as was the case with the guide.</p>
<p>Thus seated, with the boulder rising several feet
above his head, Adams&rsquo;s only reliance was upon his
keenness of hearing and sight.</p>
<p>He had not waited long when he saw proof of what
the captain had told him: the animals were restless, or
rather one of them was. The quadruped thus affected
was Hercules, his own mule, who, although lying down,
twice rose to his feet, shifted his position and lay down
again. Then he sniffed as if the air contained an odor
that was displeasing to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think much of it, if it was one of the
horses,&rdquo; reflected his master, &ldquo;but Hercules has brains;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
he knows more&rsquo;n all the others together, and yet it may
be it ain&rsquo;t that after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the singular facts regarding cattle and other
quadrupeds is that they are sometimes troubled with
disquieting dreams, the same as ourselves. This trifling
cause has resulted many a time in the stampeding
of a drove numbering tens of thousands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve knowed Hercules to kick and snort in his
sleep, and one time he come mighty near breakin&rsquo; a leg
of mine; howsumever, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the trouble
with him to-night. I &rsquo;spect it&rsquo;s Injins this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Captain Dawson lay down to sleep and Vose
Adams assumed his place as sentinel, the moon was
near the zenith, but the contour of the ca&ntilde;on shut out
its beams. While Vose was striving to pierce the
gloom, over and about the four animals, he noted a
flickering tremor against the vast wall which formed
the other side of the ca&ntilde;on. A faint, fleecy veil of
moonlight having been lifted over the mountain crests,
was now flung downward and caught against and suspended
upon the projecting rocks and crags. It was
but a frosty shimmer, but the veil dangled lower and
lower, pendant here and there until the fringe rested
on the bottom of the gorge.</p>
<p>The sleeping miners and horses were wrapped in
deep shadow, but the tremulous, almost invisible veil
still fluttered on the further side of the ca&ntilde;on. By and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
by, the shifting moon would whisk it up again and all
would be gloom as before.</p>
<p>The sentinel lay flat on his face and peered over the
prone animals toward the faint light across the ca&ntilde;on,
and, looking thus, he saw the outlines of a man moving
among the horses and mule. A shadow could not have
been more noiseless. Not the faintest rustle betrayed
his footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I expected,&rdquo; thought Vose; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager
Hercules against a dozen of the best horses in Sacramento
that that shadder is one of them five Injins we
seen stealin&rsquo; along the ledge this mornin&rsquo;. All the same,
I can&rsquo;t imagine what the mischief he is driving at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide&rsquo;s first impulse was to bring his rifle to his
shoulder and let fly. The intruder was so near that it
was impossible to miss him, but two causes operated
to prevent this summary course: Vose wished first to
learn the business of the intruder, and there was a single
possibility in a hundred that he was neither an Indian
nor an enemy.</p>
<p>The latter doubt could be solved by challenging the
prowler with a threat to fire, if instant satisfaction was
refused, while the firing could be made so promptly
that the stranger would have no chance of whisking
out of reach. Vose decided to wait until he got some
idea of the other&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>He could still dimly discern the form, but it was so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
obscure that had it not been moving about, he would
not have been able to distinguish it or make sure it was
within his field of vision.</p>
<p>While studying the phantom, the lower part of the
veil of moonlight on the other side of the ca&ntilde;on was
twitched up for a hundred feet. Lingering thus a minute,
it was twitched still higher; then a third flirt
snatched it out of the gorge. The shifting of the moon
had left the ca&ntilde;on shrouded in darkness as before.</p>
<p>Nothing could have attested more strikingly the marvelous
stealth of the intruder than the fact that not one
of the horses was awakened by him. The approach of
the great Geronimo and several of his Apaches was
betrayed under somewhat similar circumstances by the
neighing of a horse that they awakened, apparently
when making no noise at all.</p>
<p>This prowler was a shadow in a world of shadows.
If Hercules detected his presence, the man succeeded
in soothing the fear of the hybrid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Halt or I&rsquo;ll fire!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vose Adams&rsquo;s voice was low, but in the tomb-like
stillness a thunderclap could not have been more distinct.
The hail, however, produced no response. The
angered Vose drew his Winchester to a level, with his
finger on the trigger, but when he ran his eye along
the barrel, he failed to perceive any target. He lowered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
the muzzle a few inches and peered over the top.
Nothing was discernible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re there somewhere and I&rsquo;ll find you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of rising erect, the sentinel advanced in a
crouching posture, so that his head was no higher than
if he were on his hands and knees.</p>
<p>This clever strategy was thrown away. Within five
seconds, he was at the side of Hercules, prepared and
expecting to grapple with his enemy, who, to his exasperation,
continued invisible. Vose did not require
to have the matter explained to him, for he understood
it. Upon being hailed, the intruder instead of throwing
up his hands or starting to run, had also assumed
a stooping position. It was as if he had quietly sunk
below the surface of a sea of darkness through which
he was wading, and swum with noiseless celerity to a
point beyond reach.</p>
<p>Vose was angered but took his defeat philosophically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was too smart for me that time; I never had
it played finer on me, but I guess it&rsquo;s just as well; you&rsquo;ve
learned that we&rsquo;re on the lookout and you can&rsquo;t sneak
into camp without <i>some</i> risk of having a hole bored inter
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Vose was not yet through with his nocturnal
experiences. He held his seat for some fifteen or
twenty minutes without seeing or hearing anything to
cause the slightest misgiving. The horses still slept,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
and even the uneasy Hercules appeared to have become
composed and to have made up his mind to slumber until
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;leve there&rsquo;ll be anything more to disturb
me, onless some wild animal wants his supper&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought had hardly taken shape, when a shiver
of affright ran through him, though the cause was so
slight that it might have brought a smile, being nothing
more than a pebble rolling down the ravine, up
which the fugitives had passed the day before. The
stone came slowly, loosening several similar obstructions,
which joined with it, the rustling increasing and
continuing until all reached the bottom and lay at rest
a few feet from where he sat.</p>
<p>Nothing could have been easier than for this to occur
in the natural course of things, since hundreds of
such instances were taking place at every hour of the
day and night, but in the tense state of the sentinel&rsquo;s
nerves, he was inclined to attribute it either to the Indian
that had just visited camp and slunk away, or to
one of his comrades trying to steal a march upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;spose the next thing will be for him to climb over
this boulder behind me and drop onto my head. Howsumever,
if he does, he&rsquo;ll find me awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vose sat thus, depending almost wholly upon his
sense of hearing to apprise him of the stealthy approach
of an enemy, while the long silent hours gradually
passed, without bringing additional cause for alarm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>INSTINCT OR REASON</h3>
</div>
<p>As the night wore away without bringing any further
evidence of the presence of enemies, the solicitude
of Vose Adams was transferred to the two, who, hardly
a mile distant, were awaiting with equal anxiety the
coming of morning. They and he had agreed upon the
plan to be pursued, but now, with the crisis at hand,
the guide became apprehensive about the final issue.</p>
<p>Suppose the couple should leave their hiding place
to return to the main trail before their pursuers were
out of the way? Mutual discovery was certain with
the dreadful catastrophe that none dreaded more than
he. But it would seem that Lieutenant Russell was too
cautious to run the risk of so fatal a mistake. He would
reconnoitre the ground and keep out of sight until the
coast was clear, but the restless Adams was astir at
the first streakings of light in the ca&ntilde;on.</p>
<p>He first visited the animals. It was possible that the
stealthy prowler of the night before had done them injury,
but, so far as he could ascertain, nothing of the
kind had occurred. Except for what he had seen and
heard during the darkness, he would not have known
that a visitor had been in camp.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>It was not fully light when the others rose from their
primitive couches. Water was at hand, and after
drinking and ablution, the group sat down to their
morning meal, which disposed of the last remnant furnished
by Vose Adams. While they were eating, he
told of the occurrences of the night and was surprised
that his companions made light of them. To them it
was of less importance than to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as they do no more than prowl about the
camp,&rdquo; remarked Captain Dawson, &ldquo;we need feel no
concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Brush, &ldquo;that if the fellow
intended mischief, he would have done it, but he has
left no traces of anything of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which was because the right kind of chance didn&rsquo;t
show itself,&rdquo; said Vose; &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t have a lively fight
before this bus&rsquo;ness is over, I&rsquo;m much mistook, but it&rsquo;s
time we was moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide seemed to have forgotten his resentment
of the night before and his friends were too considerate
to refer to it. It took but a short time to make the animals
ready, when the procession started up the gorge,
Vose, as usual, leading, with the captain next, then
Wade Ruggles, while the parson brought up the rear,
that position naturally falling to him.</p>
<p>Men and beasts were refreshed by their rest and
food, and it required but a brief while to reach the top
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
of the gorge, where, as will be remembered, it terminated.
It was here that Vose Adams began his fine
work, and he showed no more hesitancy in drawing a
&ldquo;long bow,&rdquo; than on the previous night, when pretending
to account for his long absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trail leads to the right,&rdquo; he said, with a glance
at the ground, as if to refresh his memory.</p>
<p>His first thrill of misgiving came when he saw the
parson pause and look searchingly at the ground. Had
he possessed one-half the skill of Vose in trailing, he
would have discovered that the guide was misleading
them, but he did not have that cleverness nor did any
other member of the party. The glance of the parson
was perfunctory and his brief pause was to regain his
breath after the short but laborious climb of the steep
slope. Vose was watching him closely and quickly
saw the meaning of his action, for, whatever Brush may
have observed on the ground in front of him, it was
not the faint impressions left on the stones by the fugitives.
Neither the captain nor Ruggles so much as
looked at the earth, accepting the dictum of their guide
without question.</p>
<p>It was not deemed best to mount the animals, because
of the roughness of the ground and the belief
that they were close upon the parties for whom they
were searching. Vose took care to turn so sharply to
the right that they were speedily out of sight of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
spot where he had parted from the fugitives. Everything
was going promisingly when Wade Ruggles
startled his companions by the exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helloa! there&rsquo;s that dog Timon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hundred yards to the left rose a pile of rocks, the
highest of which reached an altitude of two hundred
feet or more. Upon the crest of one of the lower rocks,
which had only a slight height, the immense dog stood
in plain sight. It looked as if he had started to ascend
the rocks, when he discovered the party and paused
to learn their business.</p>
<p>The picture was a striking one. The enormous size
of the brute gave the impression at first that he was a
wolf or some wild animal that had challenged the advance
of the four men. This error would have been
made had not each been so familiar with the creature.
As he stood, his formidable head raised, his forequarters
being slightly higher than the remainder of his
body, his position was diagonal. He was surveying
his acquaintances, who surveyed him in turn with equal
curiosity.</p>
<p>Vose Adams&rsquo;s heart sank. What was the meaning of
this? As he viewed it, the presence of the dog could
have no other significance than that the lieutenant and
Nellie Dawson were close at hand. Timon was in their
company and would not have strayed far, so that he
had betrayed them. From some cause, which the guide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
could not comprehend, Lieutenant Russell had made
a change of plan and placed himself almost in the path
along which Vose was leading the pursuers, in the
belief that the fugitives were at a safe distance.</p>
<p>The four men looked at the dog for several moments
in silence, when the captain spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be very near them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead right,&rdquo; added Ruggles in the same undertone;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em cornered sooner than we expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t go far,&rdquo; said the parson, &ldquo;without being
stopped by the rocks, when we shall have them in
the nicest trap that was ever set for any game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reflection of Vose Adams was of a different
nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they make fools of themselves and upset all my
plans, what can I do to help &rsquo;em? Why didn&rsquo;t they
stay where they promised to stay, and why didn&rsquo;t they
kill that blamed dog afore he played this trick on &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timon stood for two or three minutes so immovable
that he suggested a stone image of himself, carved out
of the rock on which he was perched. Then he emitted
a single husky bark and leaped lightly down from
where he had been standing. It was no more than
a dozen feet, and he alighted as gracefully as a panther.
He trotted part way to the horsemen, who were
closely watching his movements, stopped, barked again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
and wheeling, trotted forward over precisely the course
Vose Adams was taking when checked by the appearance
of the canine.</p>
<p>The men looked at one another in astonishment. The
action of the dog was unaccountable, but Captain Dawson&rsquo;s
explanation sounded reasonable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows we are on the right track and he has
come to guide us to where they are awaiting him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There could be no doubt of it. The actions of the
brute said as plainly as so many words: &ldquo;Come with
me and I will take you straight to the people you want
to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of following Timon at once, the party kept
watch of him. He trotted a dozen steps and then
paused and looked back. Observing that he was not
understood, he emitted several more barks, took a
couple of steps and then repeated the performance. His
object was so evident that Captain Dawson said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as plain as the nose on your face; the animal
is worth a dozen guides like you, Vose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you foller him?&rdquo; sulkily asked
the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we shall do; come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observing that the captain left his horse standing,
the parson inquired the reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are of no use to us and will be only a bother;
leave them here until we need them; I will follow the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
dog and you can take what order you choose, but,&rdquo; he
added with unmistakable earnestness, &ldquo;every one of
you must keep in the background till I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Timon held his motionless position until the four
men had taken several steps toward him and there could
be no error as to their intention. Vose Adams observed
that he was following, without a hair&rsquo;s variation,
the course he had in mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It serves &rsquo;em right,&rdquo; was his angry reflection;
&ldquo;when the leftenant spoke &rsquo;bout hunting up a new
trail through the mountains, I oughter knowed he
hain&rsquo;t no sense and was sure to make a mess of things.
Now&rsquo;s he gone and sneaked off where these folks will
stub their toes agin him; I&rsquo;m &rsquo;sprised that the Queen
didn&rsquo;t hammer a little sense into his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide was in a torture of apprehension. The
impending outcome was likely to betray the deception
he had used, but it was not for that he cared. There
could be no mistaking the deadly mood of Captain
Dawson and the equally intense hatred of Ruggles and
Brush. A meeting with Lieutenant Russell made a
frightful tragedy inevitable, and no one could be more
vividly aware of the fact than the young officer himself,
for Vose had impressed it upon him, but the guide
in his anguish of spirit, saw no possible escape from it.
He stolidly followed, striving to brace himself for
what must soon come.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the strange leadership continued. Timon
seemed to be impatient, for occasionally he broke into
a trot, abruptly pausing and looking back, as if to urge
his followers to use more haste. Since they did not
do so, he checked himself, when about to pass beyond
sight and waited for them to draw near. He led them
around boulders and masses of rocks, over ridges, down
declivities, across one small stream, through a ravine
and again among the precipitous piles of stone, until
even the hardy men were well nigh exhausted. They
had traveled fully a mile over a route that was of the
most trying nature.</p>
<p>It was about this time that an extraordinary suspicion
began forming in the mind of Vose Adams. He
hardly dared give credence to it, but it took greater
hold upon him with every few rods of advance. Nothing
in the world would have induced him to make
known his suspicion, but it continued to grow.</p>
<p>Suddenly Captain Dawson stopped. As he looked
around his face was agitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s something infernally
strange about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vose Adams saw that his own suspicion had entered
the mind of their leader, but the countenance of the
guide was as blank as that of a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the worst tramp I ever had,&rdquo; remarked the parson,
removing his hat and mopping his forehead.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any harder work,&rdquo; added Ruggles,
&ldquo;count me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Dawson looked angrily at Vose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vose shook his head and prevaricated still further by
adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor what you&rsquo;re driving at either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dog has misled us; instead of conducting us
to the couple he has taken us away from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true and every one of the four knew it. The
suspicion of the guide had become certainty. Was it
instinct or reason that controlled the animal? Who
shall draw the line in explaining many of the actions
of the brute creation?</p>
<p>Vose Adams was silent a moment and then emitted
a low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang me, if I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;leve you&rsquo;re right, captain.
I&rsquo;ve been told that that dog knowed more than a good
many folks and there ain&rsquo;t no doubt of it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disgusted parson exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t one of us think of that? The idea of
all four being fooled by a dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have been so bad if there had been two
dogs,&rdquo; said Ruggles, who saw the grim humor of the
thing, &ldquo;but it is tough to have our eyes shet by only
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was impossible for Vose Adams wholly to restrain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
all evidence of his pleasure. When in the depths of
despair, he was awakened to the fact that the canine
had performed one of the most brilliant exploits conceivable.
He could not help smiling. The captain
was in an ugly mood and in a threatening voice asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have anything to do with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; me and Timon fixed up the thing afore
he left Dead Man&rsquo;s Gulch; it took us a good while; the
dog didn&rsquo;t think it would work, but I stuck to it and
finally he promised to have a try at it; certainly we
fixed it up atween us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide did a clever thing in thus turning the fantastic
belief of the captain into ridicule. Had he protested,
he might have added to the suspicion against
himself. It was further in his favor that it was known
he had never had much to do with Timon. As already
related, the brute had few friends among the miners
and Vose Adams never sought his acquaintance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was impossible to brush out of sight
one significant fact,&ndash;&ndash;the long absence of Adams the
day before. But for the last occurrence, nothing would
have been thought of the former, but it was clear that
Captain Dawson had begun to entertain doubts of the
loyalty of his guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never repeat his trick anyway,&rdquo; exclaimed the
officer, facing about and bringing his rifle to his shoulder.
But his intention of shooting Timon was frustrated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
for the brute was nowhere in sight. Unreasonable
as it might sound, it looked as if he suspected how
things would turn out and took the occasion to place
himself beyond danger from the indignant men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the army we shoot spies and traitors,&rdquo; remarked
the captain, so angered by his repeated disappointments
that he could not govern his feelings. In giving expression
to the remark, the officer made a serious mistake,
which he saw the moment the words left his lips. He
was suspicious of Vose Adams, but he should have
concealed all evidence of it, until the proof appeared.
When that took place, he would shoot the man with
no more hesitation that he would have shot the dog.
But he had now put Vose on his guard and the difficulty
of detecting him was increased tenfold.</p>
<p>As if to obliterate the memory of his words, the captain
said in the most matter of fact tone he could assume:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mistake we made has taken us from the right
spot; they must have been near the rocks where Timon
showed himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said the parson, &ldquo;and were watching
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one thing to do is to retrace our steps; perhaps
the two may be fools enough,&rdquo; bitterly added the
captain, &ldquo;to wait for us, since that seems to be the only
way by which we shall ever come up with them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>A single short bark startled them. The captain
wheeled like a flash with his gun at his shoulder. But
Timon was too cunning to show himself. It is not improbable
that he meant the expression for a note of
triumph over his inimitable exploit, while such a wonderful
dog was too wise to run any risk of punishment
from his indignant victims.</p>
<p>The hunter is sustained against fatigue by the excitement
of the chase; and, despite the severe labor of
following the canine guide, all four men stood it far
better than the return to the spot where the pursuit began.
Angered, chagrined and in desperate mood, even
the grim leader was forced occasionally to stop and rest.
Nearly two hours passed before they descried the familiar
pile of rocks in their front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but what good can it
do us? It&rsquo;s a wonder if they have not run off with our
horses; it would be a fitting climax to this folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the secret wish of Adams, from the moment
of discovering the cleverness of Timon, that this very
thing should be done. If Lieutenant Russell took such
a precaution, it could not fail to be effective. Returning
to the main trail after his pursuers were out of the
way, he would have an open path through the mountains
to Sacramento. If the lameness of Nellie&rsquo;s pony
continued, her saddle could be transferred to one of
the other horses, and, leading or driving the remainder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
of the animals, the four men would soon find their task
a hopeless one.</p>
<p>But the young officer was restrained from such action
by a certain chivalry that governed all his actions.
He could not consent to take so unfair an advantage of
an enemy, even though the fate of one dearer than his
own life was at stake. And yet it must be confessed
that the lieutenant drew it very fine. His course did
not win the respect of his enemies, who were inclined
to attribute it to stupidity, rather than courtesy.</p>
<p>But no time was to be lost in deciding their line of
action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better make a hunt among them
rocks,&rdquo; suggested Wade Ruggles.</p>
<p>The others studied them with as much interest as if
it were the first time they had been seen. If the couple
had taken refuge among the caverns and crevices of
this immense pile of stone, they must have left their
animals on the ground below where they could be readily
discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well have a look,&rdquo; remarked the captain;
&ldquo;what do you think, Vose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything; don&rsquo;t ask me any questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He never looked more angry. He had not forgotten
the slur of the captain and had spirit enough to resent
it. Dawson was too proud to apologize and he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
not do so, when his suspicion of the fellow&rsquo;s loyalty was
as strong as ever. On the contrary, having made his
blunder, the officer drove the arrow home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you didn&rsquo;t take that resolution in the
first place; it would have been better for all of us,
though not so good for those we are looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain and Ruggles now turned to the right,
while the other two took the opposite direction. They
were thus enabled, after more hard work, practically to
pass around the mass of rocks, returning to their starting
point, without having discovered any traces of man,
woman or their animals. On the journey, Adams and
the parson exchanged few words, but it was different
with the other couple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of his long absence yesterday?&rdquo;
asked the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has a bad look,&ndash;&ndash;worse than I thought when he
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it with the action of that dog. You didn&rsquo;t
fail to notice that Timon took us along the exact route
that Vose was leadin&rsquo; us over and we found out that
it was the wrong one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believe he purposely misled us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost sartin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose it <i>was</i> certain, Wade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d shoot him quicker&rsquo;n lightning.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So would I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see we can&rsquo;t be sartin just yit; if Vose is
in that kind of bus&rsquo;ness, he&rsquo;ll give himself away purty
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you and we&rsquo;ll watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus was the momentous bargain made.</p>
<p>When the four came together once more, the parson
remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief that after we were well out of the
way, the two went down the gorge to the main trail
and are now making haste to Sacramento.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exact line of action that had been agreed upon!
Vose Adams was firmly convinced that this was the
very thing that had taken place and the utmost he could
do was to prevent the horsemen from acting on that
theory until the fugitives were given opportunity to
pass beyond reach.</p>
<p>Except for the words of Captain Dawson, the guide
would have striven to delay the pursuit, but he dared
not attempt it after the warning. Ignoring the captain,
he said to Felix Brush:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n likely you&rsquo;re right, parson; that would
have been the most nat&rsquo;ral thing for them to do and it&rsquo;s
no use of our standing here and talking, when every
minute counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can quickly learn the truth; it isn&rsquo;t far to the
gorge, where they must have left traces; leave the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
horses here, for we can soon return for them if it proves
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgetting their fatigue, the four walked back over
their own trail. The forenoon was well advanced, and,
by this time, the fugitives were probably a good way
off. Adams was relieved because of this action, for it
promised more delay.</p>
<p>Reaching the beginning of the gorge, all began an
examination of the ground, for the imprints of the
horses&rsquo; feet were plainly seen. To the amazement of
every one, each hoof pointed upward, that is away from
the ca&ntilde;on. There was no evidence that any quadruped
had descended the slope. All had gone up. Vose Adams
was in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have let their only chance go by,&rdquo; he bitterly
reflected; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too late now to save them!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>AT BAY</h3>
</div>
<p>Lieutenant Russell held a long consultation with
Nellie Dawson, after the departure of Vose Adams.
His first intention had been to press their flight with
all possible vigor, and, as will be recalled, Adams carried
away that belief with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My view of matters has undergone a change,&rdquo; he
said after a time to his companion, who looked up in
his face for an explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of waiting until we reach Sacramento for
a meeting with your father, I believe it will be much
better to have it as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, though curious to say, she had
been wavering for some time in her belief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will add to rather than lessen his anger, if he is
obliged to follow us that far, and the fact that he is
in a city instead of the mountains will not decrease his
determination to do me injury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about those who are with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is the only one to be considered. My
proposal is that we wait here till to-morrow morning
until they come up; what is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are right; let us do so; I don&rsquo;t think
father will cast me off when I go to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plan was carried out, though the young man felt
more misgiving than his companion suspected. He
remained on guard a part of the night, sharing the duty
with Timon, whose almost human intelligence made
him as reliable as a trained scout himself.</p>
<p>Straight to the spot came the pursuers soon after
daylight, when the horses were saddled and bridled.
Nellie was in a state of feverish expectancy. When she
caught sight of her father, leading the others, she joyfully
uttered his name and ran toward him with outstretched
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, my own father, are you not glad to see
your Nellie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still holding his Winchester half-raised, he glanced
sternly at her and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come no nearer; you are no daughter of mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped as if shot, and with hands still outstretched
stood motionless, with her eyes fixed yearningly
upon him. She was like a marble statue, without
the breath of life in her body. All were silent. Even
Timon looked from one to another without moving.
The whole thing was beyond his comprehension.</p>
<p>Then the dreadful truth seemed to force itself upon
the consciousness of the girl, who staggered backward
to the nearest boulder, upon which she sank and covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
her face with her hands. She did not weep, for
her grief was too deep.</p>
<p>And who shall picture the sorrow that wrenched the
heart strings of the parent? There was a strange look
on his face and his massive frame trembled. But he
quickly recovered his self-poise, and looking away from
his child, fixed his eyes upon Lieutenant Russell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with <i>you</i> that I have to settle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young officer was standing beside his pony, with
one arm resting on the saddle, across which his rifle
was supported, while the other hand lay idly on his
hip, and his body was borne upon one foot. His pose
was one of negligence, as if he and his animal had taken
position before the camera, and the world contained no
such thing as hatred and enmity. He looked calmly
into the angered countenance, while he waited for the
next words of the man who was impatient to send a
bullet through his heart.</p>
<p>Wade Ruggles and Felix Brush would have been
glad of the privilege of doing this, but they felt that
for the time they were out of it. The right of calling
Lieutenant Russell to account lay with the father of
Nellie. They had nothing to do or say until that tragedy
was ended, and they stood apart, silent, grim and
watchful of everything.</p>
<p>The coolness of the young man disconcerted the captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
for the moment. Feeling it unnecessary to hold
his weapon, he lowered the point, but, never once removing
his eyes from the face of the other, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you the same chance as myself for your
life; though you do not deserve to live, it shall never be
said I took any advantage over you. Each of us has a
revolver and knows how to use it; you may pace off
the distance for yourself, but make it short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain, I decline to fight you,&rdquo; replied Lieutenant
Russell, without a change of pose and in his usual voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; demanded the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have saved my life on the battle field; we have
been comrades; we have drank from the same canteen;
shoot me if you wish; I will keep the position I now
hold and you may stand where you are; you have your
Winchester in your hands; you have but to raise it and
it will be all over in a twinkling, but nothing that you
can say or do will induce me to harm one of your gray
hairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reply was unexpected to all, but it served if possible
to intensify the wrath of Captain Dawson. He
shook with tempestuous rage, and it was several seconds
before he could command his voice. Ruggles,
Brush and Adams did not stir or whisper a word to one
another. The white-faced Nellie remained seated on
the boulder, but she lowered her hands and stared at
the two, as if she could not comprehend it all. Once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
she made a motion to rise, but sank back and stared
with a fixidity of gaze that went to the hearts of the
three spectators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a sneaking scoundrel to use those words,&rdquo;
said Captain Dawson, when able to command his voice;
&ldquo;all the past is wiped out except that of the last two
days; I shall shoot you for stealing my child from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lieutenant looked calmly into the countenance
of the man, and, lowering his tones almost to a whisper,
that was perfectly audible to all, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at your disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the moment Captain Dawson learned of the
flight of his child, he had been eager for but one thing,&ndash;&ndash;the
opportunity to draw bead on the miscreant, without
giving him an instant to prepare for death. That
opportunity was his but he hesitated. Something that
he could not explain, but which incensed him, held his
hand motionless.</p>
<p>But perhaps the end would have been the same, when
he rallied from the momentary struggle, had not his
daughter awakened from the daze that had held her
mute and motionless. Like Pocahontas, she sprang
forward, with arms again outstretched, and with a
faint shriek, flung them about the form of her lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot father, if you will, but you shall kill me
too!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>Felix Brush shivered and turning away his head,
muttered in a broken voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, Wade! I can&rsquo;t stand this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruggles attempted to reply, but the words choked in
his throat. Still he and Adams kept their eyes upon
the three before them. Ruggles was on the point of interfering
when Nellie Dawson averted the necessity.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Russell was disconcerted. His lip quivered,
and, with infinite tenderness, he sought to loosen
the arms that entwined him, but she would not permit
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no! He shall not part us! Let him slay us
both! Do not repulse me! I will die with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The situation of Captain Dawson was awful. He
was scarcely himself. The dainty form of his child
could not fully shield the athletic figure of Lieutenant
Russell, strive as much as she might, and the opening
for the threatened shot was as clear as ever. Whether
he would have persisted in his intention can never be
known, for at that juncture the startling incidents were
succeeded by one still more startling and unexpected.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>NO BRAVER DEED EVER WAS DONE</h3>
</div>
<p>The hearts of two of the party were wrung as never
before. Wade Ruggles and Felix Brush saw with
noonday clearness the dreadful mistake they had made
in the past in hoping to win the heart of the maiden
who had declared that if her beloved was to die she
would die with him. It was contrary to nature and the
laws of God, and it was characteristic of each that he
felt a thrill of gratitude over the belief that no person
suspected his secret. Both would have died rather than
allow it ever to become known.</p>
<p>With this awakening came a transformation of feeling
toward the couple. They sympathized with Lieutenant
Russell, but more than all, they pitied her whose
soul was distraught with grief. They had never before
seen her in the agony of distress and neither could stand
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brush,&rdquo; whispered Ruggles, &ldquo;this must stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hold!</i>&rdquo; called Brush in a loud voice, striding commandingly
forward with his arm upraised; &ldquo;I have
something to say!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></div>
<p>There was a majesty and an impressiveness of mien
like that of the Hebrew prophet who hushed the tempest.
Captain Dawson, without moving body or limb,
turned and glared at the intruder; Ruggles kept his position;
Nellie Dawson, with arms still clasping the neck
of her betrothed, looked over her shoulder at her old
friend; Lieutenant Russell reached up so as to hold the
wrists of the girl, while still retaining his grip upon
his rifle and fixed his eyes upon the tall, gaunt figure
that halted between him and Captain Dawson and a
little to one side of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Frederic Russell, do you love Nellie
Dawson?&rdquo; was the astounding question that fell from
the lips of Brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, more than my life,&rdquo; was the prompt response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have started for Sacramento with the
purpose of making her your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my resolve with the help of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Nellie, you agreed to this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; we shall not be parted in life or death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such being your feelings,&rdquo; continued Felix Brush,
in the same loud, clear tones, &ldquo;I pronounce you man
and wife, and whom God hath joined together let not
man put asunder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a thunderclap. No one moved or spoke for
a full minute. Felix Brush was the only one who
seemed to retain command of his senses. Stepping forward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
with a strange smile on his seamed countenance,
he extended his hand to the groom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to congratulate you, lieutenant; and,
Nellie, I don&rsquo;t think you will deny me my fee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With which he bent over and tenderly kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Mr. Brush, are we really married?&rdquo; she asked
in a faint, wild voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As legally as if it were done by the archbishop of
Canterbury and if&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he got no further, for her arms were transferred
from the neck of her husband to those of the parson,
whom she smothered with her caresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart! You are the nicest, best, sweetest,
loveliest man that ever lived,&ndash;&ndash;excepting Fred and
father&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>me</i>,&rdquo; added Wade Ruggles, stepping forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you, you great big angel,&rdquo; she replied, bestowing
an equally warm embrace upon him.</p>
<p>The two rugged fellows had won the greatest victory
that can be achieved by man, for they had conquered
themselves. When the great light broke in upon their
consciousness, each resolved to let the dead past bury
its dead and to face the future like the manly heroes
they were.</p>
<p>And no braver deed ever was done.</p>
<p>Poor Captain Dawson! For a time he believed he
was dreaming. Then, when he grasped the meaning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
of it all, his Winchester dropped from his nerveless
grasp and he staggered and would have fallen, had not
Lieutenant Russell leaped forward and caught him in
his arms. He helped him to the boulder from which
Nellie had risen and then he collapsed utterly. The
soldier who had faced unmoved the hell blast of battle
had fainted for the first time in his life.</p>
<p>Nellie ran to the brook a few paces away, and catching
some of the water in the hollow of her hand darted
back and flung it into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, dear father; it is all right; rouse yourself;
O, Mr. Brush, suppose he is dead!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
turning terrifiedly toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is as likely to die as you are, and you don&rsquo;t look
just now as if you mean to put on wings and fly away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the veteran revived and looked confusedly
around him. He seemed unable to comprehend
what it all meant and his gaze wandered in a dazed way
from one countenance to another without speaking.
Nellie was still caressing him, while Lieutenant Russell
stood back a couple of steps, looking pityingly into the
face of the man who had suffered so much.</p>
<p>Felix Brush was the hero of the occasion. Turning
to the group, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leftenant, you and Nellie and Ruggles and Vose
move off for a short distance and leave him with me for
a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></div>
<p>Understanding his purpose the three withdrew, and
the two men were left alone. The captain instantly
roused himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does all this mean, Brush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that you and Ruggles and I have been the
three infernalist fools that ever pretended to have
sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? In every way conceivable. Wade and I,
as we told you, saw that those two were in love with
each other; instead of persuading you to consent, we
have helped you to prevent it. I must say, captain, that
though Wade and I played the idiot, I think the championship
belongs to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to suspect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you see, parson, I had never thought of anything
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which goes to prove the truth of what I have just
said. If you hadn&rsquo;t been blind you would have seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got the belief into my head that his intentions
were not honorable toward Nellie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never made a greater mistake; Lieutenant
Russell is the soul of honor; heaven intended him for
the husband of Nellie, and we were flying in the face of
Providence when we tried to prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is all right; but how is it possible for
a man to make such a consummate ass of himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have just given a demonstration of how it is
done, Wade and I adding material help in the demonstration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain looked to the ground in deep thought.
When he raised his eyes there was an odd twinkle in
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, parson, wasn&rsquo;t that a rather cheeky performance
of yours, when you made them man and wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The circumstances warranted it. There&rsquo;s no saying
what might have happened, if it had been deferred
for only a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied the veteran thoughtfully; &ldquo;it begins
to look as if the hand of Providence was in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in everything that occurs in this life. It was
in your coming to New Constantinople; in the blessed
influence of your child upon that barbarous community;
in the impulse that led you to bring Lieutenant Russell
to us, and now comes the crowning Providence of all
in their marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parson, you ain&rsquo;t such a poor preacher after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can preach a little, but my practice has
been away off, though I hope to get back one of these
days to where I was, but&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly turned and beckoned to his friends to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
join them. They came smilingly forward, for they suspected
what it meant.</p>
<p>Captain Dawson rose to his feet, and, without speaking
extended his single arm toward his child. With
a glad cry she flew into his embrace and pillowed her
head on his breast. No one spoke, but there was not a
dry eye among the spectators, while the silent embrace
lasted.</p>
<p>Finally the daughter was released and then the captain
reached his hand toward his son-in-law, who
eagerly stepped forward and grasped it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lieutenant, we have drunk from the same canteen,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and now let&rsquo;s all go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was accordingly so done.</p>
